Madam President.
Kenya was not always the scene of disorder and brutality.
I was myself in Nairobi for the World Conference of Women in 1990, when the city peacefully welcomed 13, 000 women.
That is unthinkable today.
Everything has changed.
Today there is the rule of fear, terror and violence by the Police and by gangs.
Kenya's tourism is under threat as an important source of foreign exchange, neighbouring countries fear that the crisis will cross their borders.
We appeal to the parties, whether they be in Government or Opposition, not to support any kind of violence, but to turn against any form of terrorism, to enable constitutional reform with the possibility for freedom of expression, and to prepare for free elections.
This concerns their own race, after all.
It concerns their own people and their own families.
Corruption must be combatted and I, too, should like to end with the proposal: the Commission and the Council should make much more use of their opportunity to use article 5 of the Lom√© Convention in the ending of human rights abuses on behalf of the population.
Kenya will be another example of how seriously we take our own human rights clauses, which we insist on having in agreements, and how effectively we are able to enforce them.
Kenya is a great African country.
It has played an important role in the past, a peaceful role as well, and it could play this role again, if it should be successful in restoring public order, democracy and the rule of law.
I think we cannot do enough to try and influence these countries, because we have seen that we are in a position to do so.
We must support, therefore, all those who are prepared to restore peace and public order.
