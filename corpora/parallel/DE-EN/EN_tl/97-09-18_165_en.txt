Madam President.
We discussed the situation in Kenya back in June and expressed our regret at how violent the situation there was.
This situation has not improved.
Fear, terror and violence rule the land, violence by the state forces.
We are currently concerned at the unrest and the wave of brutal oppression which exist, and which have already cost many people their lives.
We are concerned by the latest attacks by armed militia who have forced many thousands of people in Mombasa to leave their homes.
Kenya is, however, a signatory to the Lomé Convention.
Precisely because of this convention and its article 5, we are obliged to assert ourselves on behalf of human rights in Kenya and to demand of the government or the president that the promised constitutional reform at last be implemented, and thus the basis for elections be prepared.
We support democratic conditions in Kenya.
That is also the demand of the local opposition, so that there may be an equal chance in the elections.
We, as the European Union and as signatories to the Lomé Convention, can implement this by means of political and economic pressure, and it is my view, Mr Pinheiro, that it should be included in the next Lomé meeting, which is imminent.
