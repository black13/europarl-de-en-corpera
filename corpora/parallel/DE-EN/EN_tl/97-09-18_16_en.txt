Mr President, I think it really is a perverse world we have to deal with here.
I do not refer to the excellent report by Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, but to the convention that is the object of the report.
There is no basic charter of rights, no common justice policy, no Europeanization of the internal policies of the Member States of the European Union, which might be the only imaginable constitutional basis for what is happening here.
Instead of at last taking the necessary steps, however, what does the Amsterdam Treaty do?
It formulates in Article 3 a series of declarations of intention whose legal content is, to put it mildly, entirely unclear.
I admit that the convention we have before us creates some clarification, particularly that the very constitutional rights of the previous extradition agreement are to be discontinued.
This is a further example of how in many Member States the justified battle against organized crime is being so conducted that the basic rights of citizens are being limited.
The K3 convention goes a step further, however, in that it conducts this limitation of citizens' legal rights by means of an international agreement.
That is a step that no parliament in the world which is committed to constitutional principles can permit.
For this reason the Committee on Institutional Affairs is absolutely right to demand that the parliaments of the Member States do not ratify such an agreement.
So what should the European Parliament do now?
It should not continuously complain about how it was not consulted.
It has no need to be consulted if it has no opinion on civil rights!
