Madam President.
I am truly sorry to have to contradict my good friends, the previous two speakers.
I have been to Bahrain on more than one occasion.
I know a bit about the history of Bahrain, back into the Forties.
It shows that these reports on Bahrain had nothing whatever to do with realities there.
We must not forget one thing: there is no doubt that certain excesses exist there, as in all Arab countries, which we cannot oppose sufficiently strongly.
On the other hand, however, Bahrain is under extreme threat from Iranian forces.
Shiite extremists, guided by the Iranian authorities, are responsible for the unrest one has seen in Bahrain generally.
Naturally they are anti-Government.
There is also a simple reason why they want to overthrow the Bahrain Government.
One merely needs to look at a map.
Bahrain has a, if not the, key position in the whole region.
If extremist forces were able to take Bahrain they would destabilize not just the region, but effectively create great violence.
I have to say that if we were successful in overthrowing the Government of Bahrain we would then really see what is meant by violence, oppression, repression and torture.
It is my view that one should certainly speak gently to the Bahrainis.
They are not our enemies.
But one should make quite clear to them that we would defend them against this threat from Iran, that we would support them, and that we would do everything possible to ensure that greater freedom is created in Bahrain, but that, in God's name, internal order there should not now be destroyed.
For that reason we shall vote against this resolution.
