The unavoidable prerequisite for any peace process in Columbia is a basic improvement in the human rights situation in the country.
More than a million people are displaced in their own country, not just because they are caught between the fronts of the guerillas and the army, but because they have been sacrificed to the ever-worsening social conflict.
Large landowners like the regular army maintain paramilitary gangs that drive people away from fertile land.
You must all remember the exemplary case of Hacienda de la Cruz, as an example.
Human rights exponents are not safe in their homes even in Bogota, the capital, as we have recently seen from the murder of two members of CINEP.
It is possible, however, to see a glimmer of hope in this situation, as the Government has offered peace talks to the guerillas.
We are very ready to do everything in our power to support this process.
And that goes for both sides.
They must sit down at one table and at last negotiate, but it has got to be more than just a PR exercise to refresh the damaged image of this government.
We are very ready to help here.
