Madam President.
It is a long time since we spoke in this House about human rights violations in Chile.
Despite that there are still open wounds which have existed since the time of President Pinochet.
An amnesty law guaranteeing the military immunity from prosecution has so far prevented those guilty of the hideous crimes carried out by the military dictatorship in the country from being themselves brought before a court and sentenced.
The days of immunity from punishment, however, may now be over.
For just this very reason our resolution today is so important.
An action brought in Spain by Spanish lawyers is about to lead to an investigation into crimes against humanity carried out by the dictatorship.
If this leads to the opening of a criminal case - as is foreseeable - Pinochet would even have to be extradited to Spain under an existing extradition treaty.
I think it is very important for other states to follow this example, so that these wounds can finally heal, because only one who also knows the facts can forgive.
