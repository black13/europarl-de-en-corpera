Madam President.
The point about this resolution - as we understand it - is also to show that we as Europeans always have a particular responsibility for the punishment of those guilty of crimes under a dictatorship.
Transition from a dictatorship to a democracy is a development which many countries in Europe have made.
This has often not been easy, nor did it take place by simply altering the form of state government at a stroke.
This is not a matter of revenge, therefore, nor of proving that perhaps the new democracy in Chile is not sufficiently stable.
It is essential, however, to seek out and sentence those who were responsible for crimes during the dictatorship.
Transition from dictatorship to democracy is always a bit of family history as well.
My generation has experienced that here in Europe.
It concerns the fate of perpetrators and victims who were part of one's own family and whom one has to acknowledge as part of our history.
Perhaps it is only the recognition of this development in one's own family that has made our democracies in Europe so stable.
For this reason the prosecution those responsible is a basic requirement for the stability of a new democracy.
An amnesty or statute of limitations is not an expression of generosity, but in the end would cause a destabilisation of Chile's democratic future.
This is not a matter of revenge, but of a process by which one proves that a democracy is strong enough to condemn, not those who simply carried out orders, but those who were specifically responsible for crimes.
