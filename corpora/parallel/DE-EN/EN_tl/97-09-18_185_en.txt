Madam President, according to my information there are different designations of the item in individual versions.
That which appears in the German version as recital C appears in an English version as recital D. That will be amended.
There are also some in this House who would like the recital to be omitted entirely.
I should like to call on my colleague Moorhouse to say if he could not omit completely recital C in the German version and recital D in the English version.
