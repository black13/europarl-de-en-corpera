Madam President, human rights are indivisible and wherever they are violated we in this group, like many others in the House, will always condemn them.
But just as we declined yesterday to talk again about Turkey, so we shall not always be able to give our approval to this resolution.
Because, if you demand in recital G an open and continuous dialogue with China about this question, then it makes no sense to pass a resolution against China at every sitting of this House.
In the same way it really makes no sense at all - and I would ask you to remember this in future - always to combine the subject of human rights with the question of the external integrity of the Peoples' Republic of China, in which things are demanded for Tibet which even the Dalai Lama does not ask for!
I do ask you to consider that.
We are united in our opposition to violations of human rights.
We cannot permanently connect this, however, to the question of the integrity of the Peoples' Republic of China!
