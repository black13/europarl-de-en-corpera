Madam President, as a Parliament we were active participants at the Ottawa Conference, called by Canada when it became clear that the official organs of the United Nations would not be in a position effectively to fight the mines situation.
The first success came during negotiations in Brussels.
During the Brussels meeting we were able to observe that the United Nations had indeed moved their position slightly at the standing talks in Geneva, and had appointed a coordinator for mines problems.
I must admit, however, that since then his activities have rather escaped my notice.
The Ottawa Conference represented a source of hope for millions of people.
In the meantime we have learned to keep our objectives very limited and to reduce them.
I should myself be satisfied if we could achieve a situation in which markedly more mines were cleared than were laid.
We had hoped to come a small step nearer this objective when we learned that the United States was also to participate at the Oslo talks.
This was a hope which has now unfortunately come to nothing.
In my view, though, this cannot be the end of this development, because I believe that public opinion in the United States will finally cause the USA to refrain from isolationism and become active participants in the process once more.
I think this should be a lesson to the United Nations, that there are countries that want to progress, and will not wait until the very last mine manufacturer is ready to stop production.
I should ask you, when voting on this resolution, to ensure you adopt the oral amendment resolution that Mr Bertens and I have introduced, so that the declaration is brought up to date.
I believe that a unanimous vote by this House on the matter would greatly hasten the subsequent conferences in Ottawa.
