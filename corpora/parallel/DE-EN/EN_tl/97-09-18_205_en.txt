Madam President.
First of all I should like to thank all those in this House, such as Mrs GÃ¼nther, Mr Bertens, Mr Cunningham and others, who have made such an important contribution to the fact that we can celebrate success today, despite all the limitations mentioned.
My sincere thanks, anyway.
I can also say that my Party will support the motion because of our interest in the subject, despite the reservation that the introduction of oral amendments of this size must not be made a precedent.
As has already been said, the last day or days in Oslo have proved to be a success.
We are very pleased that agreement has been reached.
I may say with pride and pleasure that Austria, my homeland, was one of the first to speak out for a total legal ban.
I am of course sorry that America is not, or not yet, participating, even though this really contradicts the principle that President Clinton himself always puts forward.
I hope that there are forces in America strong enough to persuade the President - force him, I would almost say - to add his signature after all.
I and my Party, however, should like to see this total ban remain undiluted.
We simply have another task ahead of us regarding the United States of America, rather than having to accept a diluted version now.
There is certainly still a task to be carried out in Europe.
That can be seen from the resolution and the amendment resolutions to it.
Even in Europe there are some who need to be convinced that it is not right, even with the problems which may arise from its long frontiers, for anti-personnel mines to be used here.
No one who has been to Bosnia, no one who has been to any country where every day they produce casualties killed and wounded, can accept any argument for the continued use of anti-personnel mines.
The situation in these countries, the situation of the families, the children, the people, demands that this total ban be signed by every European country and by the whole world.
