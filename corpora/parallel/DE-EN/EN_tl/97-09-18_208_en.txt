Madam President, landmines, anti-personnel mines, mines of any kind are the Devil's work and should be neither used nor manufactured.
The conference in Oslo is a first step, a first victory, but we should beware of praising its result too highly.
I think that would be a hypocritical policy.
Many Third-World countries are not participating: Russia, India, China, and now even the USA, are not signatories.
For the most part they are not signatories because western countries manufacture high-tech mines, and thus do not want anti-tank mines to be included.
When we look at the situation in Bosnia we see that 30 to 40 % of deaths in Bosnia are caused by anti-tank mines.
Anti-tank mines which have anti-personnel mines integrated in them.
Of course they must also fall within such an agreement.
In the Bundeswehr of the Federal Republic of Germany there are still 1.5 million of these anti-tank mines.
When we are talking about anti-personnel mines it is easy for a Foreign Minister or the Minister of Defence simply to say there will be no more anti-personnel mines by the end of 1997.
If we really want to ban mines, however, then these anti-tank mines must be included.
Furthermore, we must not allow any more funds to be invested in research, with which point I should like to come to a close: companies such as Diehl and Rheinmetall are developing the next generation, in which a single mine will cover an average area of 300 m2 , which makes it impossible to search for these mines.
We have advanced a small step, therefore, but there is a long way to go, and mines have got to be banned.
We must not produce any more of them, and we in the European Union should put that into practice and present a good example.
