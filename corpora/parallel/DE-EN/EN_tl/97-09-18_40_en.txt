Mr President, speaking as a blacksmith who himself comes from a family business I particularly welcome this report.
It shows that new public management is operating here and that with objective processes like benchmarking and best practice opportunities are being sought to improve the situation in many small European family businesses.
There is a trend towards the strengthening of many small businesses in Europe.
When one sees that in 1992 there was an average of seven employees per business, and in 1995 it was six, then one can understand that the small firms are actually the main pillar of the economy and also offer employment security: they do not work a hire and fire policy during economic swings, but prefer one of partnership because they are all known to one another.
It is important, therefore, that training and career improvement are supported, and it is quite impossible to understand how, when that is being discussed, Leonardo funds should be considered for cuts, to give just one example.
Quite the contrary, I shall demand at the Employment Summit in Luxembourg a marked increase in Leonardo funding, because this is exactly what gives currently unemployed young people the means of getting jobs.
I also demand that exporting partnerships should be supported, and finally that cooperation with industry should be improved, as industrial export is the basis for many small family businesses worldwide.
Age transition is also a gigantic problem.
One third of entrepreneurs in these small firms is over 50, which corresponds to about 6.3 million work places in Europe.
I support the ending of inheritance and gift taxes in particular, when a business is handed on within the family.
Also of course, that undistributed profits in the business should not be taxed.
