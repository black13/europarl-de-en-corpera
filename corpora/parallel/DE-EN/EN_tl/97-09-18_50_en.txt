Mr President, there is one thing I cannot understand.
The chairman requested a detailed discussion and then we learn that Commissioner Fischler will no longer be present this evening after 6.00 p.m.
I really do not know what this alteration to the agenda is about.
We will be talking to the birds, our arguments will not heard and we shall receive no replies.
For this reason I really must ask for a little more flexibility, because I have the following questions: is the Commission really prepared to undertake a tightening of the registration code regulations; and are there any new proposals, Mr Commissioner, over and above what was agreed in Council?
The discussion about whether we should rearrange the agenda will last longer than if we extend it.
