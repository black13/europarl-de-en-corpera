Mr President.
I should like to express my opposition to this proposal.
We really cannot adjourn the debate in Parliament just because there are organizational problems, or because of the Commissioner's personal engagements, which he may not be able to put off.
This is an important discussion.
In the Committee on Agriculture there was considerable amendment to the Commission's proposal.
That simply must be discussed.
We must also discuss if we should perhaps refer it back to the Committee, because the labelling directive, to which this proposal refers, still needs revision.
All this must be discussed here and amongst the Members.
It is impossible just to vote on it following the Commissioner's speech or statement.
I am emphatically against it and I ask my colleagues to reject this motion.
