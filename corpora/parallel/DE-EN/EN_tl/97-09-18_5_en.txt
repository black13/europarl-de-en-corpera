Mr President, we are tending increasingly to become an appendix to the administration, and no longer representatives of the people.
I really must ask you to look into it, as it is quite clear that the administration wants to take over everything, and make us into an executive.
I recently heard that someone in the administration had said that the Members were a necessary evil.
We have no wish to be a necessary evil!
