Mr President, we have here a particular situation that you have not appreciated, whereby we have interrupted a speech, but Mr Fischler is unable to be present this evening.
It is a matter of whether we must refer the report back to the Committee, and so we need clarification from Mr Fischler as long as he is present.
That is the particular situation.
That is why I am bringing up this one question again, so that we can have clarity for tonight's debate that we shall be unable to obtain tonight.
So I ask you Mr President, to allow this.
You did not realise what was taking place just now, because you have only just taken over the Chair.
As a result I ask once more if the financing mentioned in Amendments Nos 18 and 22, namely the acceptance of 100 % of the costs incurred by the industry for informing about the introduction of labels, will be reduced.
This is a one-off cost, to be financed 100 %.
It would be scandalous!
If you do not permit a reduction we will refer this back to Committee, I am fairly sure about that!
This was an important point in the Committee on Agriculture!
