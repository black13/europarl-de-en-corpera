Mr President.
I should like to draw attention to a technical error in Amendment No 3.
The last half sentence is missing from the translation and in the continuation of the amendment.
This concerns fair trade bananas.
The original amendment was tabled by our group in Spanish, and the last two lines should translate as: ...and guarantee maintenance of European and ACP banana production, and fair trade banana production.
That is what is in the original.
This is not an oral amendment, just a correction of a technical error.
I have the original before me.
The staff may check that.
It is the original.
