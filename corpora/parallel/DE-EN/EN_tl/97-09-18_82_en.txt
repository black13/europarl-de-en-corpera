I should like to introduce the oral amendment, after which we will vote again, even though we actually know better.
Yesterday we had a vague discussion with the Commission on the subject.
But we continue to support this, even if it all blows up in our faces one day.
I should at least like to introduce the amendment to our joint resolution.
I move that we vote separately on Amendments Nos 3 and 4, so that it is at least demonstrated that part of this House has kept a clear head and does not want to continue completion of scrap value reactors and permit the continued operation of another of the same, with the result that we shall have no money with which to pay for the frightful consequences.
We shall be unable in any case to pay for the human consequences...
(The President cut off the speaker)
(Parliament adopted the joint resolution)
