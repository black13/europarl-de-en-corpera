Mr President, ladies and gentlemen.
On behalf of the Greens I should like to move referral back to Committee under Rule 129, on the following grounds: we have just accepted Amendment No 22 by the Green Party.
In this we say that under no circumstances do we want a 100 % subsidy.
Yesterday Mr Fischler, in anticipation of this vote, said he would not accept the 100 % withdrawal, and that he insisted on it.
Now we come to the interesting bit, where the sales subsidies, which is what concerns the rapporteur and ourselves, will only be 60 % and 80 %.
The 100 % subsidy is for the technical introduction, in other words, the logistics of introducing labelling into the industry.
100 % is proposed for this category.
Now, the Commission did not put this into the main part of the article, but included it exclusively in the financial section.
So the 100 %, which we cannot do anything to change, is included there.
I spoke to Mr Fischler again yesterday.
He made it clear that there had been a lapse in the information chain within the Commission, and that they had not intended this.
So we need to refer this report back, so that the Commission can correct its line and follow our suggestions.
I urge Members to support referral back.
