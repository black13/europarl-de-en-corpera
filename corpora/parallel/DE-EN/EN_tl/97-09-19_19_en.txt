Mr President, we have lost the vote on for referral back to the Committee, but the problem remains unsolved.
We have been successful, nevertheless, in having this report dealt with under Rule 129a, and that means that it goes into a second reading.
Before that we shall follow with keen interest whether the Commission resolves its insecurity, which was obvious, about the withdrawal of the 100 % subsidy for the industry.
The introduction of labelling concerns not just the industry, but also farms, although farmers do not get repaid a penny for their efforts.
I think that is sensible, just to make my view on it clear.
I do not want any subsidies.
However, if one side wants to introduce something which should be taken for granted, namely the identification and traceability of beef for consumers, and must accept the financial liability, then there is no sense in paying the other side, the industry - and then a full 100 % at that!
Admittedly, setting up the logistics in abattoirs for this tagging is not insignificant, but 100 % subsidies are almost immoral.
When this is contained only in the finance section, it smacks of lobbying, of cooperation between the administration and lobbyists of the meat industry, who do not wish to bring this into the parliamentary process, but would force it on us more or less behind our backs.
We must reject that most emphatically.
We want to deal with this here in Parliament, and I hope that will happen at second reading.
