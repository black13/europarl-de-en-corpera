Let me say at the outset that all participants are agreed on the aim.
It concerns re-establishing consumer confidence in the safety and the quality of beef.
We appear not to be in agreement, however, about how this is to be achieved.
The Commission, which proposes financial support of both sales promotion measures and an information campaign on the marking of beef, seems to possess the majority support of this House.
I consider this move to be a mistake, however, because it does not define the main point of effort sufficiently clearly.
The insecurity and mistrust of the consumer stem mainly from the fact that on the European internal market the origin of beef and beef products is often unstated or untraceable.
It is for just this reason that the new regulation on identification of beef and registration of cattle has assumed such importance.
The consumer can only obtain information on the origin of beef by means of identification and registration, and only thus will confidence be created.
I think it is urgently necessary to establish political priorities.
This wish was clearly expressed at the time of the debate in plenary session on the identification negotiations.
It has become diffused in the current debate, however.
If we declare our wish for simultaneous and equally weighted financial subsidy, both of sales promotion measures and of an information campaign, then we are failing to make the clear political statement which is so important in the struggle against BSE and its effects.
Health and consumer protection have priority in European policy; security of agricultural markets is only possible when this initial priority has been ensured.
Certainly, sales promotion measures are necessary.
But we should concentrate our limited resources on what we think is of first importance, both politically and economically, and here is the creation of consumer confidence by clarification of the origin of beef.
