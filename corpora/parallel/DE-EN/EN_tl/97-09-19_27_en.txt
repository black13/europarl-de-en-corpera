Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, yesterday, when Mrs Fontaine was in the Chair, I spoke for rather a long time.
Today my speech will be quite brief.
In the past it has been demonstrated many times over the years that changes in exchange rates have led to very considerable disagreements and distortions in competitiveness.
The agriculture of Member States has had to offset this in some way or other.
The compensatory mechanisms have been insufficient.
In the reporting year 1 July 1995 to 30 June 1996 - an agricultural accounting year, therefore - there were hardly any exchange rate movements, and where there were any, they were exactly the opposite of previous years.
I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Hallam, on his report.
Even in the committee stage there was general unanimity, which I should like to record today.
There is support for it today, as well.
We should like to emphasize the demand for continuation of efforts towards simplification and greater transparency, and in particular the introduction in 1998 of new regulations, even though monetary union, the enlargement of the Union, the WTO round of talks, and particularly the discussion on Agenda 2000, are imminent and will be very emotive.
Enough about that for today.
