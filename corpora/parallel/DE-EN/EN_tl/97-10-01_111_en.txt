Mr President, allow me to say first of all that it is my custom to refrain from complimenting the rapporteur not out of a lack of politeness or because of the content of his report, but rather because of the need to be concise.
I would like to comment on another point in addition to what we have already heard.
As Mrs Spaak, in the Committee on Institutional Affairs, originally put it with truly commendable frankness in her capacity as rapporteur, our citizens feel overwhelmed by the accelerated pace of institutional integration in Europe and cannot identify with it.
We are of the opinion that it would be logical to look for another approach, an approach that would give the Member States more room for manoeuvre.
In fact, the opposite is happening.
People are looking for a new way to render an approach that our citizens do not want to accept more palatable them.
You are probably asking what all this has to do with the report before us.
We believe, as Mr Fabre-Aubrespy has already emphasized, that this report follows exactly the same political line, in that an attempt is being made to put the highest courts, such as Germany's Federal Constitutional Court and Denmark's Supreme Court, in their place, because they have drawn attention to the limits to integration.
It is for this reason alone that we cannot support the approach adopted in this report, despite the high regard in which we of course hold the rapporteur.
