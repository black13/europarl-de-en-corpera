I also asked the Commissioner a couple of questions; I mentioned that the European Union had supported or set up an early warning system in Sumatra.
This early warning system did not alert us quickly enough to the forest fires.
Why did it not work?
I would be grateful for an answer to this question.
I just think that this is important in the light of the current debate.
