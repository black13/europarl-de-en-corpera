Mr President, another quick point of clarification.
I had mentioned that it was worthwhile to support environmentally sustainable projects and, regarding human rights, to protect the peoples living in these forests.
As far as I know, funding from the European Union was used to set up and support an early warning system for the Sumatra Kalimantan region, to prevent such fires, such disasters.
In this case the Commission was very progressive and did something with a lasting effect.
My question is why this European Union project did not work.
If the question is too specific, Mr Commissioner, you can also let me have a written reply if necessary.
