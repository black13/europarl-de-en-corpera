Mr President, this is a request for procedure without debate under Rule 99(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
I would like to request the President not to adopt Mr Kittelman's very important report without debate - I do not know if he is in the Chamber.
The report is about strengthening the customs union.
We cannot adopt a report of this kind during a period when - and this is my reason - we are effectively taking part in negotiations on the accession of Turkey to the European Union, and while there are problems with Cyprus.
I would like to ask the President to proceed accordingly, as there are comments to be made, including those of Mr Kittelman.
