Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are holding this debate while nearly 30 million people in the Union are unemployed and at least 50 million are living in poverty.
We should not delude ourselves into thinking that the active labour market policy needed can be financed from petty cash.
I would like to ask the Commission if, in December, in connection with the Monti initiative, it will at least discuss reclaiming tax-raising powers, namely on financial operations, company profits and property, as in view of the stability pact this can only be done through gains on the receipts side.
Secondly, what about industry's responsibility?
What does the Commission intend to do to get industry to create jobs and training places, instead of rationalizing and dispersing jobs?
Thirdly, I welcome the fact that it will not be a deregulation summit.
But I am not satisfied with just that.
It must not be a workfare and flexible working summit either, because this USA model cannot be applied to the European Communities and even over there it has led to the destruction of social cohesion and to lasting social unrest.
