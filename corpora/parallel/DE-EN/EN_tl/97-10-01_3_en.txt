Mr President, it will be seen from the Minutes that the Friday session finished at 10.10 a.m., and that we only had a single item on the agenda.
However, our agenda today is totally overcrowded, so that an important agreement like the cooperation agreement with Macedonia will only be dealt with towards midnight.
I would therefore urge that we should organize these meetings better in future.
If we had made good use of the last Friday, we could today have dealt with this important subject during the day, in the presence of our guests!
