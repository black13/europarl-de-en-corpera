Mr President, Mr van den Broek.
We included ECU 105 million in the budget for reconstruction in Yugoslavia.
Of that, just ECU 3, 376 million had been implemented by August.
We made ECU 15 million available for 'Europe for Sarajevo' in 1997, of which ECU 623, 000 had been implemented by August.
How can you demonstrate to us, the Parliament, which at a future date will be required to give you final discharge, that the Commission is committed to making every effort actively to support reconstruction in former Yugoslavia?
Less than four weeks ago I sat in your office and we analysed together the considerable political and legal problems, and those of your own making, involved in using these funds.
We came to the common conclusion that things could not carry on as they were.
Some political imagination was needed and we had to come up with some proposals for getting out of this mess.
You agreed with this, and suggested that Mr Giansily, some other colleagues and I should undertake to get together with the Commission and consider a way forward.
We have waited in vain for this invitation, which should actually have come at the last part-session.
So how can the Commission convince us that you are really prepared to do something?
This much I can tell you: during the budget process next week, we will include a reservation, and it will not be the Parliament that has to explain to the public why this money is not flowing out, it will be the Commission that will have to explain why this money had not been made available by August and why - I think I dare say this - it will not be have been made available by the end of the year!
(Applause from the left)
