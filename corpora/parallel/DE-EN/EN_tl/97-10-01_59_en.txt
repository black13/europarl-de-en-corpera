Mr President, I have the unexpected honour of speaking after the Commissioner.
My intervention will not be so earth-shattering, but order must prevail and I am happy to accept that.
The motion for a resolution gives a very objective overview of a serious situation.
The rapporteurs deserve thanks for their work.
If in many important areas funds have been scarcely used or even not at all, that begs the question whether the contributions from the Member States, or from some individual states, are not too high.
As regards plans for enlargement to the east, the low utilization rate of Phare programme funds and of those for cross-border cooperation in the structural area are particularly to be regretted.
The extremely low implementation rate for the heading covering measures to counter violence against children is not totally devoid of a certain cynicism.
The consistently low implementation rate of funds for agricultural controls is worrying.
Bearing in mind the growing incidence of fraud and the consequent anger felt by citizens of the Union, all control mechanisms need to be fully and efficiently applied.
It is particularly hard to explain to the citizens of those countries which are net contributors why large parts of the budget which they help to finance are barely implemented.
A reform of income and expenditure policy really is needed.
With the social situation deteriorating in many Member States common decency alone demands a stricter and more efficient budget policy!
