Mr President, I would like to point out that today we have two guests from the Brazilian Federal State of Bahia present.
I myself have just taken part in a seminar on Mercosur, and I believe I speak on behalf of us all in calling for a strengthening of our relations with Brazil.
I would like to give a warm welcome to Minister Barbosa de Deus and the Vice-Governor of Brazil, Mr Borges.
Muchas gracias, muito obrigado!
