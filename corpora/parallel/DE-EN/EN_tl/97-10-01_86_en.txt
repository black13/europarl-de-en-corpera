Mr President, this report demonstrates very clearly the extent of the measures that still need to be taken precisely in the field of social and employment policy in the context of preparing for monetary union.
Every one of the suggestions and demands made by the rapporteur is valid, and I personally would support them.
However, I believe that all these points contradict paragraph 1.
The very fact that there are still no coordinated tax systems and that it has not yet been possible to reform national budgets in a socially acceptable way; the fact that in trying to meet the convergence criteria Member States are damaging the basis of social security systems - these are an indication that the deadline for introducing the Euro needs to be reconsidered.
In this context a petition for referendum is to take place in Austria at the beginning of December on the holding of a plebiscite on this subject.
This step, which is important in democratic terms, is intended to give citizens an opportunity to become involved in a critical way in an issue that affects them personally.
We believe that it is wrong to use controlled advertising and propaganda campaigns to persuade our citizens that all the social and employment policy problems that need to be solved in connection with the introduction of monetary union simply do not exist.
European monetary union should be treated as a final and important aspect of the internal market at a point in time when at least the most serious problems, including social policy problems, have already been solved and the most important conditions have been achieved.
