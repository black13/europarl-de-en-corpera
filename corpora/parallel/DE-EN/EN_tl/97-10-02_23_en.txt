Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Martens Report is a good basis for guidance of future discussion and, I hope, the design of Lom√© V in accordance with future needs.
I should like to highlight one aspect that does not seem to me to have been sufficiently considered.
For that reason my group has made additional proposals, but I think they conform to the line taken by the Committee on Development and Cooperation, and I hope the rapporteur will be able to agree with them.
They concern access of women in particular to basic services, be these education, health services, or even equal rights to participation in decision-making processes; for the key to development lies in strengthening women's rights.
That is a proven fact and has been discussed for years in great detail.
We have the concept of mainstreaming in the European Union and I think mainstreaming must be valid also for our development work.
Accordingly, I hope we will add to the report during voting.
