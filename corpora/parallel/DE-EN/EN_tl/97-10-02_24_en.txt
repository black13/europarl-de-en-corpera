Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the successful cooperation between Europe and the ACP countries should be continued in the future, and I personally thank Mr Martens most sincerely for taking on the work of introducing this.
There are, however, several points concerning cooperation between Europe and the developing nations which are certainly capable of improvement, despite certain successes in the past.
That is also a reason for our talking it over in such detail today.
In this context it can also be seen that a comparison of the Green Paper with the report shows how much the debate has moved on.
Nevertheless, in my view a number of questions, to our partners as well, remain unanswered and worthy of debate.
Firstly, there is the question of efficient management.
We can see difficulties in acceptance of cooperation in the northern countries, if no efforts are discernible here for securing the aid by a functioning administration.
Secondly, there is the point about expenditure on armaments.
Some developing countries have in past years always spent more money on the army than was available for training their citizens.
A third point concerns resources, which are sometimes rich.
This raises the question of how much the population benefits from the country's wealth, or is it only the few who do so?
In this context one must also ask whether all ACP countries are equally poor, or whether there should not be a certain amount of differentiation.
The developing countries must be strengthened to accept ever more responsibility for their own futures, and it would be nice if we could see the day when transfers of this magnitude were no longer necessary.
But until that day these countries must be confident of our solidarity.
