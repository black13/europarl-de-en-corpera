Madam President, I should expressly like to congratulate Mrs Nel van Dijk on the report about animal transport.
I believe this is the first step that we in Parliament have taken to get out of this situation, namely to make the conditions of animals at least more bearable.
As a farmer, however, I should like also to say that animal suffering begins before transport.
That is merely the last straw in what they have to undergo, because what we do to them is barbaric, how they are force-fed, how they are reared, how they are slaughtered.
It is far removed from how we believe we can and ought to treat other creatures.
It is no use rushing off to church on a Sunday to pray, and say that all creatures are God's creation, and then treat them like this.
It is shameful and outrageous, what we get up to!
For this reason I am very pleased that this resolution has been passed in Parliament with such a large majority, because then people in the national parliaments may wake up and think for themselves what it means to live together in this creation, in this world.
As I have said, animal suffering does not just begin with their transport, and I can but ask Mr Fischler to continue on the path towards finally changing his agricultural policy to one which includes the rearing of animals in a way appropriate to their species, finding a method of dealing with animals that is worthy of that description.
