Madam President.
May I first record for the minutes that both I and my colleague Karl Habsburg-Lothringen have voted, or intend to vote, against paragraphs 16 and 17.
We are not quite sure if our machines have operated properly, but we intended to, and have, voted against paragraphs 16 and 17.
I should like to explain on behalf of my Austrian colleagues in the VP, and also for Mr Frischenschlager in the Liberals, why we rejected the eight hour clause.
This is not because we were in favour of a longer transport duration, but just the opposite: we consider eight hours too long, and in Austria we already have a maximum transport of six hours laid down in law.
We shall certainly never tire of pressing in this Parliament for other European states, countries of the Union, to accept the six hour ruling.
We were simply unable to vote for this measure, because anything else is for us cruelty to animals, and in our view should be prosecuted as a crime in all European countries.
