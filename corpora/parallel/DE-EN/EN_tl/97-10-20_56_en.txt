Mr President, in view of the fact that the future information infrastructure worldwide will depend to a large extent on telecommunications satellites, one cannot but support Mr Hoppenstedt's report, since we must prevent Europe from falling behind in this sector of industry.
It is particularly important to incorporate the ESA in the Commission's plans and to push ahead with research and development in this area.
The amazing advantage of satellite systems is that they provide the means to achieve the political objective of universal access by all citizens to the information society - at competitive prices.
Finally, let me cite an unrealistic example of a rational application.
At Telecom Interaktiv in Geneva, EUTELSAT showed that Internet services could be received by satellite.
A special new Internet channel, the European tourism channel, brings tourist information systems into the home and therefore provides a revolutionary new route for efficient tourism marketing.
