Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when the then Soviet Union put the Sputnik satellite into orbit in 1957, it caused consternation around the world - the interest then being primarily of a military nature.
The first civil applications, primarily television transmission between America and Europe, were not exactly breathtaking - namely a time window of some eleven minutes.
Today we accept the satellite-supported worldwide telephone network and direct television transmission as normal.
But development never stands still.
Satellite-backed communications with worldwide coverage will be part of the future technology of the next Millennium.
So in this respect we must welcome the fact that the European Commission is making proposals to remedy the current situation and respond to the challenge by encouraging public and private investment in this sector.
However, let me now draw attention to a number of aspects which are not being given due consideration.
Firstly, the Commission's proposals are mainly focused on the market and on private initiative.
I believe that this does not give us a parity of weapons with our main competitors.
As ever, the necessary impetus is coming from the armaments industries of America, Russia and China.
And it is no secret that in Japan the old relationships still ensure that sufficient support is provided, even from the MITI.
Secondly, it is high time for us to reflect on the significance which this technology will have for the increasing globalization of the labour market.
I am not against this, but we should not wait until it is too late before beginning to talk about it.
Thirdly and lastly, we must also see to it that earth-bound broad-band networks, which allow access to the new system, are also extended to cover a greater area, otherwise the benefits of the new technology will only be available to our towns and cities and the rural areas will be left out.
