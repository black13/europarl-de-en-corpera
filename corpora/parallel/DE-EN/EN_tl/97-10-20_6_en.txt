Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I can only add to what Mr Medina Ortega and Mrs Fontaine have said.
I too had the doubtful pleasure of appearing on television.
I hope that at least the picture quality during this important contribution was enough to prevent us coming across as too ugly.
I must admit that I made previous inquiries as to the length of the session.
I was informed that it would run until about 10 a.m.
I was then on official duty, in my capacity as a member of the Latin American delegation, en route for Brazil.
I wish that those journalists - and luckily only a few of them work this way - could spend a week with some of us to see exactly what we do.
I doubt they could stand the pace.
I do not wish to reiterate what has already been said by other Members.
Enough opinions have been expressed on the matter.
We simply will not stand for it.
If your intention is to make us clock in and out, then the answer is an emphatic "No thank you' .
