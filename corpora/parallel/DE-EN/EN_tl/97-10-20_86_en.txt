Madam President, we are at second reading!
At first reading, Parliament was almost unanimous in approving the repair clause.
The Commission supported Parliament in this and the Council avoided making any decision.
On the crucial point, namely what we do about the spare parts sector - which was after all the point of the directive - the Council avoided the issue.
Now the matter is going through second reading in Parliament and we say that we did not mean to take things quite so seriously.
This sort of thing only undermines Parliament.
In future the Commission and the Council will not take Parliament's first reading seriously - even if there is unanimity in the House.
There have been two high court decisions, namely in the House of Lords and the Italian Constitutional Court, which state that the legal protection of designs only protects the design and not the components which constitute it.
All the same, these are just high court decisions!
We are now being told that jobs are under threat.
The repair clause does not deprive the car industry of its market share of the spare parts trade but merely opens it up to competition.
Car manufacturers currently control 88 % of the spares market!
They operate an effective dealer and sales network and there will always be plenty of customers who prefer to use factory-produced components.
To talk of a decline in this market share is therefore totally unrealistic.
The question is whether or not the free market will in future be able to maintain a 12 % share of the spares business.
Manufacturers quite simply want to have a monopoly of this market, and that is not desirable.
