Madam President, it is regrettable that the debate on the very important report submitted by Mr Medina Ortega concerning the legal protection of designs has basically become restricted to the repair clause.
In my opinion a decision supporting this repair clause would represent a pyrrhic victory for the motorists' representatives.
By this I mean of course a pyrrhic victory not in the economic sense but rather in the legal sense.
I can well understand the arguments of motorists' representatives and spare parts manufacturers, but as a lawyer I cannot recognize any objective criterion for abandoning the principles of design protection in respect of car spares of all things.
In fact, I consider this development highly questionable and possibly even creating a precedent.
In truth, the matter under consideration has, I believe, more to do with competition than design protection and it should be judged from that viewpoint.
