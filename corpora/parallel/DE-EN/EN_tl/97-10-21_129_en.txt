Mr President, while not wishing to belittle the good work of the rapporteur, I must say that the draft budget represents nothing more than an extrapolation without any clear consideration of the main political priorities and with no real initiatives for reform.
The most serious problem, as we all know, is the high unemployment figure, particularly youth and long term unemployment.
This muchvaunted initiative to combat what has become a problem of serious proportions, while in itself a remarkable achievement, is still far from satisfactory.
It is still particularly regrettable that the ECU 3.5 billion allocated to research and technological development still represents less than 4 % of the total budget.
It is hard to conceive of another area which is as important for long term employment as research and development, especially in view of the fact that the EU is continuously losing ground to the USA and the Asiatic countries in the field of technological development.
At the end of the day, real jobs can only be created by a healthy and competitive European economy.
