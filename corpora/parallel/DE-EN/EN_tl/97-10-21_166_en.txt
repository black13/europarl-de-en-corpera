Mr President, today's schedule has been rather difficult, with the Committee on Budgetary Control and the BSE monitoring committee both meeting at the same time.
I have just left the talks with President Santer, now that the opportunity has presented itself, and in this respect things have proved quite convenient.
Mr Bösch, who is to be congratulated for producing such an excellent report, is quite right in urging greater cooperation between the Commission and the European Parliament in a number of key areas, and particularly in one which is of great interest to our peoples - namely, what is really happening with Europe's money and is it being used to best effect.
We fully agree with many of Mr Bösch's comments, which have cast a critical gaze over the activities of the Commission and, in some respects, over those of UCLAF too.
Let me come back to the BSE monitoring committee.
What is apparent here is that it was in no small measure due to UCLAF, which can be and indeed has been completely efficient in this matter, that we were able to expose beef exports from the UK into other Community countries via the so-called Irish connection .
I therefore believe it to be in all our interests to continue down the road of mutuality, while also seeking to strengthen our existing instruments.
In addition to what has already been said, I consider it indispensable in the long run that in the area of criminal law we get to grips with the facts relating to fraud with Community funds.
It is for the very reason that the Community is held in this light that we do not want to see it constantly meddling in areas which were originally the domain of Member States.
However, where this is necessary, and when it is important for reasons of financial correctness, then we should not stand in its way.
