Mr President, Mrs Gradin, first let me thank you wholeheartedly for the support you have given to Europol.
My concern is the following: Switzerland is not only a threat from the point of view of drugs, but in another area too.
There exists, particularly in Germany, a smear campaign against the euro and many of the less-well-off, such as pensioners, are being sent letters from Switzerland advising them to invest their money in Switzerland to avert the threat of the euro.
At the same time they are being offered investment funds promising a 30 % rate of return - and that is simply an economic impossibility.
Switzerland is therefore building an investment pyramid in the same way as a number of former-Communist countries did some years ago.
Mrs Gradin, I ask that something is done urgently to warn people of this situation.
