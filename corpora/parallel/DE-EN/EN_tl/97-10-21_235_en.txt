Excuse me, Mr Commissioner, but this discussion prompts me to make a small inquiry.
Do you not sometimes think it contradictory that the Commission should on one hand behave so admirably in informing us of the dangers of cancer, while at the same time providing substantial funds each year, and in fact probably more, for the promotion of tobacco growing - an industry which even from an employment point of view hardly justifies such rewards?
