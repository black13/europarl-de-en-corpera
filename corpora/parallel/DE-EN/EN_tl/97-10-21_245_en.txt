Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen still in the Chamber.
May I first of all thank Mr Baldarelli and Mr Kaklamanis for their reports.
While I do not share the conclusions which Mr Kaklamanis has drawn from today's meeting, both Members have gone to some trouble to prepare their reports and I believe that the claim that interested Members have attempted to delay the agreement cannot be upheld.
Commissioner Van den Broek, and my remarks are also addressed to Commissioner Kinnock, we simply must devise a new system for informing Parliament of the negotiations which the Commission logically is required to conduct.
This sort of communication problem between Parliament and Commission cannot be allowed to continue.
In spite of the information breakdown, Mr Kaklamanis, we should be pleased that Parliament is to ratify both agreements tomorrow, one hopes with a large majority.
These agreements are important not only for rebuilding and opening up the two countries concerned, but also for helping our Greek partners, whose transport and trade links with the rest of the Community have been seriously affected, to put it positively, by the war in the former Yugoslavia.
How important it is for us to come to the aid of Macedonia and Slovenia, and indeed Greece too.
The third pan-European Conference on Transport, which was held in Helsinki in June of this year, served to indicate that we need greater European cooperation in the transport sector, both from an infrastructure point of view as well as with regard to transport and communication.
In this respect we should be pleased that both reports are being debated here today and will be voted on tomorrow.
Neither of the two countries concerned will have cause for complaint against Parliament.
Let us voice our approval so that both agreements can take effect.
