Madam President, in view of the current figure of 18 million unemployed, an improvement of the employment situation is the greatest challenge currently facing the Union.
We have all experienced a certain amount of scepticism when talking to our citizens, the most common question being "what is the point of Europe if it cannot safeguard our jobs?' .
I believe that if decisive action is to be taken against unemployment, then Europe must also be brought into the hearts and minds of its citizens.
Amsterdam has set a clear assignment.
The objective, or as Commissioner Flynn puts it, the result, is to create 12 million new jobs in five years - an ambitious undertaking, particularly since no additional resources are to be made available.
This begs two questions: first, do the financing plans stand up to critical analysis, and secondly, are the measures being taken really suitable?
If we are talking about a release of funds by the EIB, incredible though that may be, then a closer inspection proves to be somewhat sobering.
According to an internal German study, the EIB funds referred to are only sufficient to create a maximum of 60, 000 new jobs.
The measures proposed by the Commission for combatting unemployment are well known.
The report on employment opportunities in Europe in 1997 basically reiterates previous calls for a reform of taxation policy, better training programmes, a reduction in labour costs and many other measures.
The implementation of these measures is the responsibility of each Member State.
The EU can only participate through exchange of experience, since Europe lacks suitable job-creation instruments.
It remains to be seen whether Amsterdam will give the EU in Luxembourg a new impetus and, more importantly, whether Europe can maintain its credibility and fulfil the hopes of its citizens.
