Mr President, I regret that my opportunity to speak has only come after the vote.
The European Parliament has in its deliberations already caused a scandal in allowing this important report to be debated with so few seats occupied.
Indeed, only the employment experts from the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment were present.
Now we have added to this by the fact that with our contribution to the employment summit we fell below the minimum level required.
This is an absolute scandal and we have now only voted for the resolution to prevent an even bigger one.
