Mr President, I wish to speak for a different reason, but first just one sentence: I reject the insult to Mr Schulz' parents and to all our parents, and should like to express opposition to all forms of collective blame.
That is upheld in this House.
I say this as a German and a European.
I wanted to put a question to the Commissioner, however, and that is why I rose to speak.
She did not react to it in her answer.
Madam Commissioner, I just wanted to know why you did not address a proposal on burden sharing to the Council.
Did you fail to receive a majority for it in the Commission?
Or was it a predisposed obedience towards the Council?
That is my specific question.
