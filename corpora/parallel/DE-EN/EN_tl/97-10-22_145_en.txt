Mr President, we are talking about the ingredients of chocolate and its name.
Of course it is our task to protect European consumers adequately, and to ensure that products can be designated.
In the debate about chocolate, however, much more is at stake.
We are also voting on the way of life in cocoa-producing countries.
A discussion has developed in the forefront of this debate, which we should never forget in future.
In the medium-term we need a fair partnership between European consumers and producing countries.
That means that we must also ensure that the fairest possible production conditions exist in those countries.
The more seriously we take this responsibility, the more people we can free from enslavement to neo-colonialist economic powers and lead them to peace and affluence.
I believe that is a task which benefits both sides.
