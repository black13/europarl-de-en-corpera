Mr President, I should just like to say something on the Rules of Procedure.
You are already aware of the matter.
I am not criticizing you all the time, for you are of the right opinion, but our Bureau and the Conference of Presidents, because Question Time can almost never be utilized in full, now that it has been moved from the evening to the afternoon.
Every part-session is subject to late starts, and each time I criticize that, a representative of the Bureau tells me that it was an exceptional case.
I should like to know how many exceptions we are going to allow ourselves, and whether we should not now accept the consequences and hold Question Time at a set hour.
