Mr President, Mr Commissioner, I should like particularly to thank the rapporteur for continuing to press for the new opportunities of the information society to be treated by EU legislation not just as matters for the internal market and commerce, but as cultural concerns.
It then becomes unavoidable for copyright law to become the focus of this work.

My groups amendments all have the aim of addressing this problem in future legislation, and thus taking a currently rather fluid terminology to normative clarification.
I believe that is why the Organization of Composers, Creative and Performing Artists specifically supports them.
The Barzanti report seems to us, however, to be an important advance in this direction, with which we completely agree.
