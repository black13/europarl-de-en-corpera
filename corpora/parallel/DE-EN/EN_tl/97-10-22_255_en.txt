Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, food additives have a particularly important role, not only because they are significant to quality and price, but because they are important to the consumer.
Austria, Finland and Sweden have a tradition here and I think that this question is of particular importance to those countries.
I believe the identification guideline is sufficient and that it is unnecessary, where E407 and E 407a with the eucheuma alga are concerned, to amend existing law.
These products are not going to be sold to consumers, but only to the processing industry, which has learnt how to handle them and where it is clearly seen as sensible for them to be used in the future.
Even the Philippines, which are to a large extent involved with the supply, can draw attention to the fact that these products are permitted in Australia, New Zealand, Japan and the USA, and recognized as very useful.
After all, 240, 000 jobs depend on this product in the Philippines.
I believe we should give serious consideration to the fact that this is also a matter of the future in these countries.
