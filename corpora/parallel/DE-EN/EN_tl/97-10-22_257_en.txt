Mr President, both Mrs Schleicher and Mr Rübig have pointed out that they support the identification regulation, but are of the opinion that it does to belong here, but rather in the framework directive.
You too have told me that, Mr Commissioner.
Hence my question: if we agree that this identification regulation should receive political support, but we disagree where it belongs in law, can we then agree for the Commission to make a declaration to the effect that, should Parliament pass these regulations, they will be accepted into the framework directive?
That is my question to the Commission.
I see that Mrs Schleicher is nodding.
I hope she would also be in agreement with such a regulation, because identification is, after all, what the consumer wants.
Then I should like to put another question, Mr Commissioner: Mr Gerner, sitting next to you, said a few days ago at the last vote in the Committee on the Environment, that the Commission would not support it because of these very doubts expressed here.
He pointed out that there were other possibilities: that technically one could avoid the use of messin.
I should be interested to know what has brought about this change of mind within the Commission, and if new information has become available.
Another matter, because the Commission has just declared that we were sent the report with the definition of technological necessity: I believe, and several of the speakers here - Mrs Dybkjær and also Mrs Schleicher - have mentioned it in committee, that that was unfortunately most unsatisfactory, Mr Commissioner, and I hope that it improves in future!
