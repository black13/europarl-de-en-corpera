Ladies and gentlemen, this is a really important report.
It concerns the future of a sector of the future, telecommunications.
It concerns the regulation of the World Trade Organization, which is establishing itself as a new World Government in many areas that are particularly important to us.
The report itself makes abundantly clear what problems exist in finding agreement, which we still have to discuss.
For example, the USA is making exceptions for itself, which it will not grant to others.
(Mixed reactions) The report draws no conclusions from this, and in view of the fact that we have come to the last moment when Parliament will discuss the matter, I do not move that it be dealt with other than as proposed.
