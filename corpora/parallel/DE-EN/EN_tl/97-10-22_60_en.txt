Mr President, I do not wish to detain you any longer.
I take note of what you say, but I should like to reserve the right to request a comprehensive statement on this from the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunity.
My interpretation of the paragraph you read out is that, because we have taken a final vote, I have a perfect right to make an explanation of vote.
I shall not, however, debate the matter any further with you now.
I should be grateful if you would perhaps join with me in requesting the Committee on the Rules of Procedure to produce an expert report on the matter.
