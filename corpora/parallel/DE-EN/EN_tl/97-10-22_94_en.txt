Mr President, there can be few problems we discuss here, which so affect us on a moral and ethical plane, as the problem of refugees.
For that reason I think it is particularly necessary to find a solution which can be upheld by a large majority in Parliament.
As this concerns a moral responsibility, however, we believe that personal off-set has been too little mentioned in the report.
The problem of refugees does not just concern paying and then deciding who pays, but it also principally demands that the whole of Europe be prepared to solve this problem together.
A further problem - and here we agree that it is a special problem - is that of a qualified majority.
One can look at it like a glass of water: either half empty, or half full.
Naturally the right of veto is a problem that one will have to argue out.
On the other hand it can be seen as positive, if it is declared to be a pan-European problem and we all have to find a common solution.
