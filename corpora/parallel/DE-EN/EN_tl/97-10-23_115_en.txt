Madam President, we regret the complete absence of any readiness for cooperation by the Congolese Government, and should like to express our deep concern about the departure of the UN mission of inquiry from the Democratic Republic of Congo.
This delegation arrived on 24 August and was forced to leave Kinshasa again on 3 October.
I think that only damages the peaceful future development of Congo.
We should like to emphasize that the UN measures must be carried out, and appeal to President Kabila to cooperate fully with the UN mission of inquiry, and to permit it unlimited and unconditional access to the interior of the country.
Otherwise, Congo is threatened with isolation and that would also endanger the resumption of cooperation.
We acknowledge that European cooperation with the new Congolese Government and authorities is crucial to promoting democratization and development of the country, which has to recover from dictatorship and war.
We further stress that prerequisites for such cooperation must be the maintenance of human rights, democratic institutions and international law.
These requirements must be met, and the UN is an important institution for that.
I hope that Mr Kabila is ready for cooperation in this respect in future.
