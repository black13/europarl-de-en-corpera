Madam President, Mr Tindemans has asked me to represent him.
I should just like to say that although Mr Kabila's second name is Desir√©, he would not be our first choice of candidate for President.
He was brought top power by American commercial interests, and we Europeans have the task of taking energetic steps to see that even worse violations of human rights than in the Mobutu era do not occur.
We should also be insisting that the United States of America work with us within the framework of Atlantic cooperation.
This concerns support for the position of the UN Commission, but also an energetic human rights policy, without which chaos will break out in the most central, most important country in Central Africa, which is also the largest and richest in raw materials.
