Madam President, some people have one minute worth and speak for two.
I shall endeavour to keep to the two minutes.
I should like to concur with what Mr Bertens has said.
We need to have a common approach, a common opinion.
Although the European states have been unable to achieve that, at least we should do so in the European Parliament.
Today we have a resolution which in my view makes a common opinion possible.
You are aware that we have had a series of resolutions to which I, on behalf of my party, was unable to give consent.
This was because human rights have been bound up here with a series of political questions on which one may legitimately have a variety of opinions.
I believe that the human rights question in China is so urgent - and not just for the principle of maintaining human rights, but also for the healthy economic and social development of China itself - that it is right for us to take this initiative.
It must be our obligation - and for this we need a dialogue with China - to convince the Chinese side that as long as human rights are not widely recognized, as long as there is no progress in this respect, there cannot be the necessary advances in economic and social systems.
A society which does to acknowledge human rights, in which they are spurned, cannot be a society that meets with broad acceptance and it simply cannot organize all human resources to achieve economic progress.
Of course, economic progress in China continues apace, but that will soon meet limits if the process of economic development does not give rise to better conditions.
For these reasons the proposals we have produced should be fully supported, and I hope that at least in this House a unified and critical, though frank and solid, front can be presented to China.
