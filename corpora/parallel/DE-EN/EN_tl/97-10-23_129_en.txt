Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately, we must deal once more with Kosovo, which is still a powder keg, and probably the most dangerous powder keg in Europe.
Recent developments have been far from positive when we look at incidents on Pristina in Kosovo itself, and when we see what tendencies the Serb elections have partially reinforced.
They have unfortunately shown that the opposition in Yugoslavia has not been strengthened in any way, nor has it found a way of creating a democratic policy which also respects human rights.
The glimmer of light emanating from Montenegro is not sufficient to alter and improve the situation to any important extent.
There is no alternative for the Yugoslav authorities to starting a dialogue that takes account of the basic rights of the minority in Yugoslavia - which forms the majority in Kosovo, after all.
It is not the intention of this Parliament or of the European Union to call for alterations to borders.
On the contrary, we must clearly signal that the borders of European states are not up for discussion.
There must be within Yugoslavia, however, a solution achieving real autonomy and real maintenance of human and civil rights.
It is also important because there are developments in nearby Macedonia and FYROM that give cause for concern.
Although these are not comparable with what is going on in Kosovo, they do lead to unrest amongst the very large Albanian minority.
Some of the draconian punishments, though, appear to me to be too strict and too unproductive.
The Kosovo powder keg can at any rate have an effect on surrounding areas and states.
All the more important that we strive by every possible means to convince Yugoslavia that it must solve its own problems, particularly in Kosovo, with our help.
