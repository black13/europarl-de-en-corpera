Mr President, western policy with regard to Kosovo is an accessory to murder.
Eight years ago Milosevic unlawfully occupied Kosovo.
Yugoslavia was destroyed by Milosevic and the Serbs when in 1988, in violation of the Yugoslavian constitution, they removed Kosovo's autonomy.
Since then they have been governed by a brutal police regime.
We have got to do something at last.
First of all, we must use pressure, not just eyewash, to see that at long last an office is opened there, similar to the one the Americans were able to establish in Kosovo without any difficulty.
We snivel, but we do nothing.
We have got to use pressure.
Secondly, we must supervise elections there with international observers.
That is essential, otherwise the police state will not disappear.
And thirdly, we must again use pressure to force Mr Milosevic to keep his vague promise to Mr Rugova, because Mr Rugova, like Ghandi, chose the non-violent approach.
We denounced him, so the young people there are resorting to weapons.
That is our fault and there is blood on our hands to this day.
