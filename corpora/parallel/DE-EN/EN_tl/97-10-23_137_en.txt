Mr President, I have read the motion for a resolution on the Slovak Republic with interest.
I have something to say against it, however, and that is that insufficient differentiation is made between the Slovak peoples and their current tyrants.
Those of us who are older, those who have some experience of dictatorships, know very well that whilst there are guilty people, there is also a wider population that one cannot necessarily punish for the fact that some monster has gained power.
That particularly applies to the situation on Slovakia.
For that reason I have to say with regret that I shall have to reject two of the amendments.
They are Amendment Nos 7 and 8, which go too far in identifying President Kovacs with Mr Meciar.
Meciar is one thing, Kovacs quite another.
Kovacs is on the side of the people.
We should do everything possible for the people, but we should resist tyrants.
