Mr President, the Joint Parliamentary Committee with Slovakia produced a specific working programme last spring.
This was unanimously accepted by both sides.
Slovakia is certainly welcome as a member; its economic development in particular is very satisfactory.
The Gaulieder case, the question of minorities, the treatment of the opposition, the election laws and one or two other things give cause, however, for considerable doubt.
If the required points are not put into action by the end of November as agreed, this will lead to serious problems.
The European Union can wait.
That will not be a problem for the European Union.
But I think that those members of government who are responsible for it will present the bill to the Slovak people, and obviously vice versa.
