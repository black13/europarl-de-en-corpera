Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs André-Léonard, I think the last part-session of this Parliament must have passed you by, at least as far as Algeria is concerned.
We did not vote yesterday as a united group.
We were against it because we had already passed a resolution on Algeria last time, after a full debate.
During that the hearing on human rights was agreed, which we obviously not only accept fully, but will also take very seriously.
Furthermore, Parliament resolved to send a delegation to Algeria.
Unfortunately - I have to address this critical remark to the Presidency - such resolutions of Parliament have to travel a long road, and I do not understand why the Presidency and the Council of Presidents have had to delay and are still delaying, and have to await the hearing.
Here I agree with Mrs André-Léonard.
The problem is so urgent and so serious, and long discussions with the Algerian Government and Parliament will probably be necessary in any case before we can send this delegation, that I do not understand why there is delay.
We could probably have dispensed with today's resolution and another short debate, were the House to react more speedily to its own wishes.
It surprises me somewhat, as a relative newcomer, that this House passes a resolution, and yet there is still a committee saying: all right, do we want it or not; perhaps it should be deferred?
If this House expresses the genuine, clear wishes of several - indeed, many - groups, then surely these should be carried out as quickly as possible.
Now a short comment on the declaration itself.
I completely agree with the contents.
This is an unacceptable situation.
We must make the Algerian Government aware that this is not just an internal problem, but one for the whole Mediterranean region.
So we will not cease supporting efforts to seek a settlement of the situation in Algeria.
