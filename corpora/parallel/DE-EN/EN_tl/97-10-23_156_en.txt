Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am surprised by some of the remarks made here, in which events have been portrayed as though this were a matter mainly of natural catastrophe and hardly capable of being influenced.
Some colleagues have made it clear that this is a close-knit web of natural factors, but it is bound up with very many important political, social and economic factors as well.
Slash and burn is frequently the cause not only of local catastrophes, but also of international and global effects.
There are two reasons for slash and burn.
Either major corporations want to clear large areas; in the Indonesian example this could be for housing, agriculture, or production of palm oil.
Or it may be because small farmers see no other way of acquiring land.
In both cases there are serious inroads into the natural life cycle, but as far as major corporations are concerned, as is particularly the case in Indonesia, this is especially serious.
It is not that we are against economic progress, nor that we are against clearance, even in tropical forest, but there must be sustainable agriculture.
Short-term profit must not be the main motive, as is the case here.
Everything possible must be done, therefore, even by the European Union.
I should really like to ask the Commission to give these things greater attention, in order to take measures against such practices and to arrive at a sensible method of agriculture which particularly favours the small farmers, those who this case are frequently driven out.
I think it is particularly dubious that there have been many press articles maintaining that a lot of these companies have some property association, or otherwise have some personal involvement, with President Suharto's relatives.
There is a lot of political corruption at work here.
I believe that all these factors should be investigated by the Commission and the Council in order to prevent or to stop this evil process, which is destroying people.
