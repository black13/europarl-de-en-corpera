Mr President, no-one could have been surprised by the news that the forests are on fire in the Brazilian Amazon.
For many years human hands have been making irreparable errors in this ecologically most fragile of areas.
For years slash and burn has been carried out without any thought, and for years other infrastructure changes have been made to permit even faster deforestation and removal of the timber, so that rain forest can disappear even more rapidly for ever.
It is a fact in all this that there has been no long term utilization of the rain forest for industrial purposes and under the auspices of multinational concerns.
The only people who can really manage the essential rain forest ecosystem are the Indians who live there.
They are the first to suffer under the current smog blanket, not the aircraft captains and car drivers in Manaus.
They have for years been the first to be expelled by fire-raising cattle ranchers and by Caterpillar tractors serving the tropical timber merchants, and they are also pressurized by landless peasants from other parts of Brazil.
If only there were land reform in Brazil, if the Brazilian Government were to introduce and enforce efficient laws against slash and burn practices, if research results from the G7 pilot programme - into which a lot of money has been poured - were put into practice, then the rain forest would be under less of a threat, and sustainable and ecologically produced goods could be on sale at a fair price.
And then the tropical hardwoods could stay where they are today in the interests of local people, the multinationals and our ecosystem.
