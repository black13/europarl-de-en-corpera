Madam President, Mrs Daskalaki's report shows very well the difficulties to which print media are subject, compared with electronic media.
New media cannot be wished away, however.
They are in any case used increasingly by newspapers and magazines.
Despite this, print media are threatened by an ambush.
Evidence of this is the decline in circulation of daily papers in the European Union.
This has less to do with the advance of new media, however, as with the trend towards print media concentration.
The only one to be successful is the one that has corresponding access to the market, that is, an appropriate distribution system.
Any policy which provides equality of opportunity for the various print media is worth supporting.
Only thus can a variety of opinions be maintained.
Newspapers and magazines should not be burdened by high postal charges, either, and thus elbowed out of the market.
Finally, one must ensure the encouragement and training of young journalists, and this training should receive EU support.
In order to equalise one disadvantage of print media against electronic media, print media should also receive global reporting guarantees.
The European Community should create the situation where newspapers can more easily open correspondents' offices worldwide.
