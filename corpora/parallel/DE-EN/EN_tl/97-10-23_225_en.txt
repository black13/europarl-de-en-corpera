Madam President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as a delegate of a country which has only been a member of the European Union for two years, I long held the opinion that ignorance or poor knowledge of Community law was an Austrian speciality.
During the debate within the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights concerning the Commission's proposal, however, I had to listen with regret to reports from other long-established Member States and discover that the situation there is not much better.
Lack of knowledge of Community law amongst lawyers, judges and public prosecutors is not just a problem for the professionalism of these professions, but also a risk for the ordinary citizen, for businesses and for the functioning of the internal market.
Previously existing programmes, such as Leonardo, the Grotius programme or the very successful Jean Monnet programme have not covered all their important objective groups sufficiently well.
But even if we should now be successful in making the projected 450, 000 lawyers and 100, 000 judges better acquainted with Union law, that will not be enough to remove the existing deficit.
For that reason I particularly welcome the proposal by the rapporteur to add a resolution which requires Community law to be an obligatory subject in all faculties of law.
That sounds very obvious, but it is unfortunately not yet the case in many member states, including Austria.
All these efforts must be complemented by constant attempts to achieve better understanding of, and easier access to, Community law.
Currently it seems that it is not easy for even well trained lawyers, judges and public prosecutors to get access to Community law.
I hope that particularly the office for EU Publications, which has made some interesting suggestions here, will also be successful in putting the proposals into operation.
Finally, may I, on behalf of my group, thank the rapporteur most sincerely for her work.
