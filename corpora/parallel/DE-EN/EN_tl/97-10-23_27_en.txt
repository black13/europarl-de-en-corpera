Madam President, the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development have tabled this again.
It concerns an increase of ECU 1 million.
That was rejected in the Committees on Budgets.
We have now reached agreement with the rapporteur that we shall try to arrange it again for the second reading.
So as not to give the impression now that this is a programme which has to be defended by Parliament against the Commission, as though it had been rejected here, we have resolved to withdraw the amendment.
on Amendment No 707
