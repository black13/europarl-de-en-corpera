Madam President, before the final vote on the second resolution I should like to thank you personally on behalf of the House and the Committee on Budgets for having just completed the whole voting procedure on the 1998 budget in hardly more than an hour.
Thank you very much.
Applause
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
