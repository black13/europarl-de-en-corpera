Madam President, the situation on human rights in Afghanistan is growing increasingly threatening.
The population is suffering from the civil war, which has lasted nearly 20 years, with catastrophic economic results, and it is suffering under the self-aggrandisement and lack of human respect of the Civil War Party.
The Taliban is a stone-age fundamentalist regime.
Its politics are aimed at the female part of the population.
They are systematically excluded from public life by means of draconian measures.
Medical assistance is forbidden, rape and terror of unbearable kinds are daily routine.
These self-styled holy wars have further victims: religious and ethnic minorities, the politically active and intellectuals.
In the Islamic world they are acknowledged only by Saudi Arabia and Pakistan.
This isolation shows that the Taliban is not so much interested in religion, as in power and money.
The European delegation in Afghanistan has shown how little they care for the Convention on Human Rights.
We must take care that with help from the European Union efforts are not relaxed, that the NGOs participate, and that this help takes concrete forms.
We must strive to achieve a peaceful end to the conflict.
The Council of Ministers cannot remain uninvolved for much longer.
