Madam President, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi has presented an excellent report on raising awareness of Community law, and I should like to say here that this programme deserves to bear the name of Robert Schuman, for he formed our Community into an essentially constitutional one.
Today we are extending this Community eastwards, busying ourselves with agriculture and neglecting this expansion of the concept of a constitutional state.
I would ask that we put real effort into more intensive training of the legal services, courts and administrations of the associated states.
I was told by the Minister of Justice in Prague that they have called upon the ENA for this purpose.
I have a high regard for the ENA, but doubt that it is the ENA's job to raise awareness of Community law.
For this we must do more to call upon the European Court of Justice, the European institutions, for action.
