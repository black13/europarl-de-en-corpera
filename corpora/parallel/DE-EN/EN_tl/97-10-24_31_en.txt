Mrs Wulf-Mathies, I want to address you personally.
Export refund are economic nonsense.
Export refunds, subsidies for the export of live cattle, are an accessory to animal suffering.
When we talk here about measures for improving controls, that should not hide the fact that the real point is to do away with these export refunds.
If the animals have been mostly paid for, when they are loaded onto the vehicles, then one can hardly wonder if they are treated in this way.
If you sell a horse, an Arab, to the Middle East for a million, you need not worry about its safe arrival.
If you subsidize animals for slaughter in this way, then exactly what we see in these pictures will take place.
These export subsidies must be stopped, therefore, and we shall be supporting resolutions that aim to do this.
Mrs Wulf-Mathies, do not deny what you really feel, but say that you too are against this foolishness, even if you are representing the Commission!
We must ensure that live animal breeders in North Africa are able to sell their animals, that they can do business with people there who want to eat meat in this way.
We must keep out of this.
Then we shall have made a sensible contribution to animal welfare.
People treat their animals sensibly, but we do not allow it.
That is the problem.
