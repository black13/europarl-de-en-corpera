Madam President, I should like to draw attention to one point.
It is absolute nonsense that groups should allocate speaking time.
We are here until 1 p.m., yet when we indicate that we want to speak, we are suddenly told there is no more speaking time, even though we are stopping before 11 a.m.!
Officially, we are here until 1 p.m., and it is scandalous that group leaders simply allocate the time and then allow no more contributions to the debate.
I must ask for a debate on this, because this is foolishness at our taxpayers' expense.
