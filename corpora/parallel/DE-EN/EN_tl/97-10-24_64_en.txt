Madam President.
Mr Rehder, we support your report, because we think it will bring a number of improvements, but we oppose on principle the policy of grubbing up.
As you know, this is not new; we have had it for decades.
It contributed to the fact that self-seeding land was destroyed, and plantations laid out because there was simultaneous encouragement for them.
These measures gave rise to the very fact that we now have overproduction, that businesses have not been market-oriented, that production was for quantity not quality, and now we have the problem of destruction.
It is exactly the same, by the way, with wine.
In the 70s and 80s there was a reorganization of vineyards so that quality vines were removed and replaced by quantity producers.
That went so far that in the Eifel foothills vines were planted on sugarbeet fields.
There too, we have to face overproduction.
That is, all in all, the wrong way to go, and we want these enabling instruments to be deleted.
We want the market to decide the rules.
We support your report, though, because we feel that a few things have been included here which will prevent the worst from happening.
I do feel, however, that we must discuss this again, and that we must approach this market issue in a fundamental way.
