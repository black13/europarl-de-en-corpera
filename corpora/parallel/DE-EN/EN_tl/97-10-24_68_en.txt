Madam President, I should like first to thank Mr Rehder for the way he has presented his whole concept.
We are dealing here with a matter that is a real patchwork of all possible temporary measures that can be taken; just as aspirin certainly helps ease a pain, but basically alters nothing about the problem.
This is the third time since 1990 that we have considered this problem.
Each time we were told that it was the last time, and when I read in the report that this is absolutely the last time, I have to say: Mr Rehder, you will find out that there is another absolutely last time, you can be quite sure of that!
This shows once again the weakness of our general agricultural policy, which has no comprehensive concept.
For that reason I am thankful to Mr Rehder for pointing out quite clearly that we shall not repair the agricultural policy if we do not put it into perspective with the future, that is, the perspective of renewable raw materials.
I have already spoken about this during the excellent report by Mr Hallam, when I said that it was absolutely essential to alter our way of thinking.
Our great error is that we utilize our research and development capability for non-renewable raw materials.
The correct policy would be to use the same effort for renewable ones.
Meanwhile we know that in the future we shall need an agriculture that is based on farming basics and that is the way of the future.
I must thank Mr Rehder.
We shall of course support the report this time, because it is necessary to maintain the existence of a few people, but we must also say that a comprehensive solution should at long last be found.
