Madam President, I have a problem.
I was outside for a moment, and during that time a woman came - most likely a staff member of this House, as my neighbour, Mr RÃ¼big, informs me - and removed my card.
When he said she should leave the card in its place, she replied that she had been told to take this card away.
I gave no one any such order.
I would ask you to take note of that.
I would like to vote.
