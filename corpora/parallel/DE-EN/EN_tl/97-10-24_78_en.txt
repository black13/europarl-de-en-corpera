Madam President.
I know that some people are amused, but the matter is not funny.
This is the second time my card has disappeared before voting.
I really must ask that enquiries be made, if someone from the sitting services is responsible, because in reply to Mr RÃ¼big's protest - he said: Mr Posselt still needs that card - the woman replied that she had been specifically ordered to remove it.
I would ask you to enquire into it.
