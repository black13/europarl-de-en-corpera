Madam President, I think I have an explanation.
Mr Posselt belongs to the Friday Club, that is, the people who, like me, always stay here to the end.
It was probably someone from the Brussels lobby who stole his card, because they are always keen to demonstrate that Friday should no longer be a sitting day in Brussels.
