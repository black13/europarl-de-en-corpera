Mr President, after long and difficult discussions on the key question of how to work out a common fisheries policy after the year 2000, the Committee on Fisheries has come up with a compromise which was accepted by the overwhelming majority of the Committee and has now been presented in plenary session.
But the way in which this report was eventually produced really was not ideal and the Committee on Fisheries must take care that it does not deal too often with such important and weighty matters with a series of compromises which then have to be rushed through the vote for lack of time.
I would therefore call on future rapporteurs to take account of the opinions of other committee members at an early stage in the reporting procedure, so that we do not have 420 amendments in committee as happened in this case.
If the report has nevertheless found majority acceptance, this is primarily thanks to the rapporteur's readiness to compromise, and I would like to express my personal appreciation of this.
A compromise cannot of course satisfy all interests entirely and certain matters of detail had to be excluded.
But I am glad to see that the principle of relative stability continues to be recognized and that access to coastal waters of Member States will continue to be restricted after 2002.
I also think the report gives sufficient emphasis to the fact that for socioeconomic and bio-ecological reasons fisheries cannot be treated like any other economic sector, even if I would have liked a clearer statement here and there.
I cannot therefore share the view of some of my colleagues who feel they see in the report an attack on community rights.
We should also not forget that this is an initial approach to the subject and no doubt this is not the last time Parliament will be debating the fisheries policy after 2002.
