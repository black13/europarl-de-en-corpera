Mr President, I congratulate the honourable Member, Mrs Ghilardotti, on her work.
With her recommendation for a directive on shifting the burden of proof in cases of discrimination on grounds of sex, she sums up admirably the resolutions of the Committee on Women's Rights.
The amendments constitute an important element in achieving a social Europe.
We Social Democrats want to see a clear directive that assists women in asserting their rights.
I trust the Commission, which has been so far very cooperative with Parliament, will continue to take this line.
We would like to see the position of female employees in cases of job discrimination, promotion and remuneration improved.
The draft under discussion for the last 15 years must, in our view, include the three key elements which Mrs Ghilardotti has already presented and which were not fully accepted by the Council after first reading.
The shifting of the burden of proof from plaintiff to employer as in Amendment No 8 must definitely be insisted on, and the burden of residual doubt must lie with the accused.
We regard this as an essential requirement.
The second clear definition of indirect discrimination, which the European Court has already embarked on in its judgement, must be clarified.
Indeed the draft Amsterdam Treaty takes the same approach.
Thirdly, we want to see the directive extended to the protection of expectant and nursing mothers and social security provisions, so as to avoid loopholes in Member States which may prevent female plaintiffs from asserting their rights to equality of treatment in the civil courts.
So on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I would ask all colleagues to accept the proposed amendments including the key contents of Amendment No 8, and I trust we will get a majority and that the Commissioner will accept these amendments.
