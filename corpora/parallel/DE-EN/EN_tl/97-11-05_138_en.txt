Mr President, the road to equality between women and men is a hard one.
It has a lot of potholes.
In businesses and organizations discrimination on grounds of sex is far too often the reality.
Women - and not only women - await concrete changes and approximation of procedures in all Member States.
The European Parliament has shown the way in this respect.
With its new common position, the Council has taken the reservations of our group into account.
Some of my female colleagues have omitted to mention this.
For example, the principle of investigation has gone.
The right to information for all parties has also been dropped.
It would have led to investigations which are not compatible with the civil law of Member States.
All the suggestions of our Parliament were accepted by the European Commission - thanks to Commissioner Flynn.
Three examples: first, the now redrafted definition of indirect discrimination; secondly, the incorporation of directives into social security law; thirdly, the obligation of Member States to report after at least two years.
There are a number of amendments tabled by the, as usual, extremely precise rapporteur, Mrs Ghilardotti, which we will not be able to accept, such as the deletion of proposals 15 and 16.
We believe that specific aspects of the legal provisions of Member States certainly must be considered, especially if there is clearly discrimination taking place.
All in all, a middle way has been found.
The accused must prove that they have adhered to the principle of equality, an important corrective in all Member States, for common legal instruments will include both direct and indirect discrimination.
The burden of proof directive has, I believe, taken us a valuable step forward on the stony road I referred to at the start!
