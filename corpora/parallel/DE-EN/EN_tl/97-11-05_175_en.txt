Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if we want to encourage acceptance, I do not think it is enough just to say we are going to have a national face.
That is just a sop!
If people are anxious about what is coming to them with the euro, it is because the part this euro is going to play in creating an economic, social and employment policy which is in their own interests has not been convincingly explained to them.
To try and respond to this by offering a sentimental little sweetener, is surely not good enough!
Either we must succeed in making the euro a political project of which people can say, this is a good thing, this is valuable, this is worth going for, or we shall have nationalist reactions.
We shall have reactions of political apathy and people will say goodbye to their hopes for the future.
We shall not be able to confront this by finding a good powerful national symbol!
I certainly do not know what symbol would have this unifying force in Germany!
I would have to think hard for Italy too, and Spain and Portugal, which I know a bit about, and I get gooseflesh at the very thought of what national symbols they might come up with!
This is not the right way.
We really must all make up our minds to go ahead with the euro as a project which is valuable and worth supporting for the broad masses of Europe, and not seek acceptance by encouraging emotional reactions and nationalist feelings.
That is surely the wrong way!
