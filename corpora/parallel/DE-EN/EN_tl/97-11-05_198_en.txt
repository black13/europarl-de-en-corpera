Mr President, in discussing renewable energy we talk about environmental protection, which is quite right.
We talk about jobs in discussing renewable energy sources, also quite right.
But we virtually never talk about the problems involved in acquiring fossil fuels.
Hundreds of thousands of people die in aid of this every year.
I am thinking of the Gulf War, the war in Afghanistan, in Chechnya and at the moment in Zaire or the Congo.
We must be aware of the full dimension of the problem, namely that no peaceful agreements will be possible in the 21st Century on the basis of fossil and nuclear energy.
So we need renewable energy sources not only for environmental reasons, economic and social reasons, but even more in the interests of peace, because there will be no peace in the 21st Century unless we switch to renewable sources of energy.
