Mr Commissioner, we were delighted to hear that a deliberate effort was made at the Foreign Ministers Conference to make it quite clear that no one is to be excluded.
It remains to be seen what decisions are made by individual Heads of Government.
In this connection the question arises again what matters this European Conference is to deal with.
What specific cases, what specific subjects of negotiation are actually to be discussed and/or decided on, and to what extent will this ensure that everyone really feels they are included in the process of approximation and future membership?
