The Amsterdam Summit did not result in any reforms, Mr Commissioner, you said so yourself.
Much more needs to be done for the Union to be capable of enlargement.
But reforms and enlargements go hand in hand.
France has suggested enhancing the status of the standing European Conference and extending it to include institutional matters.
Does the Commission support this suggestion?
Are the Council and the Commission interested in seeing the candidate countries participating in institutional reforms?
If so, how is this to be achieved?
What specific plans does the Commission have to link these processes?
