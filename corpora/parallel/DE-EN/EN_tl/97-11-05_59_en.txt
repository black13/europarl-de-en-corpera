Mr Commissioner, our group has always supported a reduction in working hours, the reorganization of transport along socially and environmentally sound lines, and guaranteeing to all citizens the basic right to freedom of demonstration.
Now and again - and increasingly often - this House has followed our lead.
Today, therefore, we in the Greens wish to express our solidarity with the striking French lorry drivers.
We congratulate the striking lorry drivers on their courage and initiative.
It is a strike for Europe, not against Europe!
Surely we are not still living in the days of Peterloo, Mr Commissioner, when the state took it upon itself to shoot at workers who went on strike.
The state today is a conciliator, and I congratulate the French Government on the felicitous way in which they have found solutions so far.
I cannot understand why you only address your remarks to the union leaders and not the scandalous behaviour of the employers' associations, who have only been persuaded back to the negotiating table with the greatest difficulty!
Mr President, Working Time Directive 104/93 does not include the transport sector and the resulting social dumping is only too clear.
Why is the Commission only proposing a White Paper again and not a Directive?
It makes one wonder what the political aims of the Commission really are!
