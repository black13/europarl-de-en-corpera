In my opinion the discussion is slowly taking the wrong direction.
In fact we have to distinguish between two separate issues: rates disputes between employers and employees in France may be justified, but these regional strike negotiations cannot be allowed to lead to lorry drivers throughout Europe being taken hostage by an internal French conflict.
This is quite unacceptable and the Commissioner has said as much.
Mr Commissioner, you said you had been in contact with the French Government.
You also said that the strike barricades were always changing and that time and again, despite the promises of the French Government, lorry drivers from Portugal, Spain, Germany or other Community countries were being held up.
Hence my first question: when, Mr Commissioner, will you recognize the emergency - preferably within a few hours - and apply to the European Court for a temporary injunction against the French Government, to make them lift the blockade and allow free movement.
My second question is this: according to article 5 of the Community law, every country is obliged to ensure the free movement of persons - this is what we are talking about here - and goods, and in my opinion when a country fails to do that it should be required to pay compensation.
What are you going to do to protect the legitimate interests of employees and contractors?
