Mr President, allow me as an Austrian to start by pointing out that the Commission's communication on which the report is based is incomplete in that, as well as the countries it names, Austria has also established the legal base making child abuse and child pornography committed abroad a crime with its Criminal Law Amendment Act 1996.
I have already indicated how very concerned we are too about protecting adolescents in the context of the discussion about setting the age of consent in Austria.
I am glad that at least in this instance protection of children is to be guaranteed up to the age of 18.
Apart from some confusion about the terms child, youth, minor and junior, the steps proposed in the report are wholly to be welcomed.
However, I feel insufficient emphasis has been given to the suggestion that this is not simply a phenomenon that can be dealt with by the machinery of criminal justice.
There is no doubt that demand is also driven by the sexual freedom promoted for decades now and whose fruits have found their way via pornography-laden newspaper kiosks into Europe's criminal courts.
Urgent changes are needed in this respect; but on the whole we agree with Mr Schulz's report.
