Mr President, the travel industry and tourism as growth sectors of the 21st century bear a heavy moral burden in this phenomenon of travel with the aim of sexually abusing children.
Airlines, travel companies and travel agencies thus have an obligation to provide preventive information for potential offenders.
The offenders are often men who have children themselves or who in their local community are good with children.
It is possible to develop a conscience in these people and thereby restrain them.
In addition to legal measures, therefore, all possible channels of preventive information should be explored by the public sector and commercial interests together.
Male passengers traveling in aircraft to certain destinations should be given not condoms but informative leaflets explaining that young girls in Thailand or Africa are just children and helpless children at that!
