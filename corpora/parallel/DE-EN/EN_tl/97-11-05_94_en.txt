Mr President, ladies and gentleman, it is almost exactly a year ago that we had a conference in Stockholm on the commercialized sexual abuse of children.
It is good to see the Commission has followed this up with these proposals and that our Parliament is discussing the matter today.
This excellent report is warmly to be welcomed so we can see how we are going to combat this abuse and what we can do to protect our children from it.
I read in the SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung this week that sexual violence among young people is widespread and that it is not only in the developing countries that young men go for drugs and alcohol or exert psychological and physical pressure to pursue their sexual interests.
I believe it is not only a phenomenon in those countries, it happens here too.
It is the fertile ground on which sex tourism and child abuse flourishes.
The report we are discussing is now taking up those calls which have been made for so many years by associations like ECPAT and other women's groups for better protection of victims and the appropriately severe punishment of offenders.
But the important thing is prevention.
First, we must do everything in our power to ensure that victims do not become offenders in their turn.
Secondly, sexual violence among youth must not turn into a taboo.
Thirdly, the families of offenders should not be herded into a sort of clan.
They need appropriate social and psychological attention.
Indeed the Committee on Women's Rights has given this careful consideration and urged us not to concentrate only on sex tourism and paedophilia.
That way we are shifting the problem onto abnormal and sick minorities.
It is more important to face the issue of the power balance between the sexes in our society today fairly and squarely.
We are all affected and we would urge everyone to address this problem for themselves and personally commit themselves to ensuring that children are no longer abused.
