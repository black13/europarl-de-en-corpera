Mr President, I am glad the last speakers have brought the discussion back to the point that really concerns us, one of the saddest aspects of our society, the abuse and exploitation of children for sexual purposes.
And now we learn that an industry has grown up around it, an international business, a pornographic industry in which large sums of money are made illegally by exploiting the weakest members of society.
It is almost a bigger business than the drugs industry.
We must move with all the forces of the law against this international trade in our weakest brethren.
So I welcome the discussion on these points relating to the fight against child abuse.
I am delighted that a package has been worked out which involves international cooperation, for only international cooperation will be successful in this case.
I should just like to take up a few points which seem to me important.
The first essential is harmonization of the law.
If this doesn't happen, we cannot deal with these matters internationally as criminal offences.
In particular I feel it is very important to introduce the principle of extraterritorial application.
We have already introduced it in our country, in Austria, and I would like to see it introduced as a possible solution throughout Europe.
I welcome the fact that other steps are to be taken as well, such as the safe custody of repeat offenders and international searches through the Schengen information system.
I am particularly glad that it is intended to apply the profits from this business to the care of victims.
All in all, this is a package of measures which I hope will find the support of the whole Parliament in the interests of the weakest members of society, in the interests of our children!
