Mr President, I would like to make a quick comment first of all.
It is terribly difficult to hear you on the German channel.
The sound quality is so poor that we cannot hear anything at all!
Excuse me for saying this, but your voice is too loud and the interpreters are inaudible.
I am sorry if this has led to a degree of confusion.
Perhaps we could ask the secretariat to have the system adjusted or set differently.
I voted with great enthusiasm for Mrs Fraga Est√©vez's report, but there was just one thing I regretted.
One point of general interest is not mentioned in this report, namely that the problems with fishing policy totally contradict what we were told 15 years ago.
We should treat this as an early warning, because what is happening in fisheries today, with the changes being forced on us, will happen in other sectors in the future.
I just wanted to point out that it might have been a good thing to draw attention to this again in the report.
