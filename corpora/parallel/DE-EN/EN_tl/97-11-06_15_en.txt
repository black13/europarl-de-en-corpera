Mr President, I welcome Mrs Weiler's report on modernizing and improving social protection in the EU because it highlights two important points.
First, social conditions in the EU have dramatically changed.
Secondly, Member States' social protection systems can only continue to be financed if they are modernized immediately, with the Member States being responsible for both the financing and the modernization.
I believe that in a Europe which includes so many differences due to regional diversity, varying historical development and above all different financing systems, a uniform social system is a utopian dream.
That is why I welcome Amendment No 16 tabled by the European People's Party.
I mentioned the change in conditions.
Women have been affected particularly dramatically.
In many cases poverty is a female condition.
That is why I agree with the proposals in this report which are aimed at providing a social safety net for women.
It is particularly important that periods devoted to child care should be treated as pensionable.
To do anything less would be to penalize women who devote themselves to working for their families, and ultimately that is an attack on the family.
