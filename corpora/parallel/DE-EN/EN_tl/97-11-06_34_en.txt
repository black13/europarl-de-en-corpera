Madam President, it is unfortunate that the Commission is not in a position to present an overview of state aid, although it accounts for 1.7 % of total gross domestic product.
The very fact that 51 % of EU citizens receive some kind of aid is contrary to the spirit of the internal market.
We need reforms which will ensure a shift away from the principle of 'equal shares for all' to one of providing targeted incentives, which would make Europe a competitive location.
Combatting unemployment is a key topic in this respect.
Incentives should not be allowed to distort intra-European competition, but in turn the competitiveness of the Community needs to be boosted.
So research and development must be an absolute priority, paying special attention to SMEs.
The EU budget reflects the disparity in aid objectives.
It is simply not acceptable that more money is spent from the EU budget on subsidies for tobacco, olives and sugar alone than is spent on research!
