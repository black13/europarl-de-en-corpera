Mr President, last Friday my voting card was stolen right in front of Mr RÃ¼big, while I was briefly outside.
I was promised that the matter would be cleared up by this sitting.
I have just been to the voting card office, and I have been given my substitute card, but it had not even been reported that my card had disappeared!
I would like to protest about this and demand that this matter be cleared up.
