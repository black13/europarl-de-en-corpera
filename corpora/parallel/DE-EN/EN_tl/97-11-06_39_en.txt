Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, yesterday I made a comment that was misunderstood.
I said it gave me gooseflesh to think of the national emblems Spain and Portugal might select, in view of the history of those countries.
I want to make it clear that I did not mean that the national emblems of those countries in particular give me gooseflesh.
I do not know any country in Europe whose national emblem does not make my flesh creep because of its long and bloody history.
That is why I regret the outcome of the vote.
