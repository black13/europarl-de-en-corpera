Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, maybe it will help to simplify the vote if I briefly explain two things about the voting list.
I explained to the secretariat that I was against Amendment No 3 on the voting list, which Mrs de Esteban Martín tabled on behalf of the European People's Party.
But I talked with Mrs de Esteban Martín again during the debate yesterday, and I am very much in favour of Amendment No 3!
So I would like to make it clear that we can vote the same way.
Mr Pradier wanted to withdraw Amendment No 4, because it is covered by my Amendment No 6.
I think that will make the vote a lot easier.
