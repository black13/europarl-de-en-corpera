Mr President, please bear with me.
We made a mistake in paragraph 25 in the heat of the debate, although I cleared this with the other groups beforehand.
In paragraph 25b, it says that the production, distribution, exhibition or any support for the production of pornographic material should be punishable, if its production involves minors.
We agreed in this House that the possession of such material should be punishable.
It should also be possible to punish the people who buy this sort of filth, the consumers.
That is not in the text now.
I would therefore like to ask you to accept an oral amendment, so that the words 'and the possession of pornographic material' are added to paragraph 25b after 'exhibition' .
on paragraph 29
