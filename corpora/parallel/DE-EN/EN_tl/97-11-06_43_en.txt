Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the controversial part of this report is paragraph 29 and Amendment No 2 tabled by Mr Chanterie and Mr Nassauer.
I would like to make the following suggestion to Mr Chanterie on Amendment No 2.
The content of Amendment No 2 goes further than my original text.
The wording is more consistent and radical as far as the role of the European Court of Justice is concerned.
But it does not take on board the idea of a claim relating to a person, and in that respect the amendment is illogical.
I would therefore recommend that Mr Chanterie accepts my oral amendment, adding the words 'and therefore demands his resignation' after the word 'responsibility' .
I would then withdraw my original text and accept Mr Chanterie's amendment.
