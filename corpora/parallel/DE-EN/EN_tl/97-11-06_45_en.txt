Mr President, Mr Chanterie has made it clear that he wants to ask Mr Wathelet to resign, for which I thank him.
That is something new in the debate, but it is not unreasonable.
On the other hand he has also made it clear that we are playing a little tactical game here.
I do not want to go along with that.
So I request that we put Mr Chanterie's amendment to the vote in the original text, and then, because it will not get a majority, vote on my original text for paragraph 29.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
