Mr President, we are grateful for the rapid progress you are making.
But I must insist - with due respect to Mrs Weiler: there has not been a vote on paragraph 15 in the original as a whole.
So far we have had individual votes on paragraph 15, and the European People's Party will vote to reject paragraph 15.
I would like to request that this should be put to the vote again.
You have not done that!
