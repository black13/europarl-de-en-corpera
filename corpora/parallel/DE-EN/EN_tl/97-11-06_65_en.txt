Mr President, yesterday evening I agreed with the spokesman of the Group of the European People's Party that in the third line, after 'social security rights' , the words 'for example' should be inserted, as examples are given.
I was told that subject to this the amendment would be withdrawn.
I therefore move that the additional words 'for example' should be inserted.
