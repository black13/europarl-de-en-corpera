Mr President, yesterday I agreed on a compromise for this amendment with the European People's Party Group, as I insist that the words 'comprehensive care systems' should be included.
If this word 'comprehensive' is incorporated, then I will accept the amendment.
Also, I would like to withdraw the word 'binding' in the second line, in the phrase 'binding legislation' .
