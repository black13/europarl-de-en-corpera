Mr President, I am sorry that I have to make a short personal comment to conclude.
This report has turned out to be very complicated, as has the vote on it.
However, I would like it to be minuted that I believe two points were not correctly voted on.
The first one is paragraph 24.
Before the vote I pointed out that I insisted that there should be a vote on the second part, which does not include Mr Crowley's amendment.
You refused.
You are perfectly entitled to do that, but I cannot agree with it.
The second point is about what Thomas Mann said on paragraph 15.
I do not think we voted correctly on that paragraph either.
You said that voting had been completed with Amendment No 22 from Mrs Boogerd-Quaak of the Group of the European Liberal, Democratic and Reformist Party.
At the beginning of the vote I made it clear that I only accepted Mrs Boogerd-Quaak's amendment as an addition, and would like to have it included as an additional point.
That meant paragraph 15 was not put to the vote as a whole.
Mr Mann, I think that as far as the procedure goes, we agree.
I must say that I find this voting procedure unfortunate.
