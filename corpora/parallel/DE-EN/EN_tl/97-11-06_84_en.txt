I would like to put it on record specifically that I am particularly opposed to those parts of this report in which a reversal of the burden of proof is called for in labour law cases.
This would conflict with the basic principles of the free democratic order.
Of course any state governed by the rule of law will have exceptions to the reversal of the burden of proof, but limited to interests requiring protection.
However, any extension of this exemption for motives of pure political agitation should be rejected.
