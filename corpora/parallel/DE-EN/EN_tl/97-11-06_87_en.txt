I believe that the reversal of the burden of proof proposed in the Ghilardotti report is the wrong way to counter sexual discrimination.
This provision conflicts with the constitutional principles according to which the plaintiff and not the defendant has to prove his accusation.
Also, an unreasonable bureaucratic burden would be imposed on companies, if they are to prove that discrimination has not taken place, should there be a complaint.
This would be the only way for an employer to protect himself against accusations by his employees and to 'clear himself' .
This would certainly have an effect on companies' recruitment policy.
It is reasonable to assume that for fear of possible difficulties with female employees, they would not be hired in the first place, with preference being given to male applicants in case of doubt.
For these reasons we cannot vote in favour of the Ghilardotti report.
