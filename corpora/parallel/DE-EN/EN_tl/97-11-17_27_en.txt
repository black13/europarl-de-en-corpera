Mr President, I wish to oppose that, because this report is a good one, and it would be a pity if we were to adjourn it.
Whether it is dealt with on Wednesday or Thursday really makes no difference.
I see no earthly reason, in any case, why we should adjourn the report.
I move that it should not be adjourned.
