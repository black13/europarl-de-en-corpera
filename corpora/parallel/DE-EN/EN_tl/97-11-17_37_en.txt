Mr President, I should like to support Mr Gutiérrez Díaz, who always presides over Question Time exceptionally well.
The right to ask questions is one of the most important parliamentary rights, but in recent years it has really diminished.
We used to have one and a half hours with the Council at the beginning of the evening session.
They were taboo and were always strictly observed.
Since Question Time was moved to the afternoon, it has been shortened in nearly every sitting by delays in the main business.
Each time we are told that it is an exception.
It seems to me that it has been an exception almost every month for the past year!
I do not mind if Question Time is held at the end of the sitting - I have absolutely nothing against that - or during the evening sitting - the Council could also meet us in the evening once in a while - but I really feel that we must adhere strictly to the one and a half hours.
Question Time must be strictly taboo.
Then we could hold it at the end of the session and ask the Council to stay twenty minutes longer, if necessary.
