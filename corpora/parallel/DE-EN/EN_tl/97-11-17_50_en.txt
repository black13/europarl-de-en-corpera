Five years after Rio, and nothing to show for it except a lot of speeches and a lot of noise - some of it unfortunately just behind me.
Absolutely no achievement.
Nor are the Commission's reports on the subject very informative.
They are vague, they lack ambition, they are insufficiently conclusive, and the biggest mistake is in the calculations - things simply do not add up.
Our aim is to achieve a reduction of 15 % by the year 2010.
Now the Commission says we need new nuclear power stations to reach that target.
Even ignoring the fact that in most Member States these are quite unacceptable to public opinion, and the fact that their costs have grown much higher than those of gas power stations, there is still a construction period of 10 to 12 years, taking us into the year 2012, or at best 2010.
How is that to be achieved in the time?
What we need is a revolution in energy efficiency.
We need a change in our road traffic, which is the largest emitter of CO2 .
We need an energy tax, and of course we also need specific regulations for phasing in of energy from renewable sources.
