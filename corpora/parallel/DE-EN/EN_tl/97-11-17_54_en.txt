Mr President, the main points have actually been covered already.
I should like to restrict myself, therefore, merely to a few facts and to a description of the situation, which is none too rosy.
We all agree on the facts.
We must do something to improve the climate and see that our CO2 emissions are reduced.
We disagree on the objectives.
What percentage reduction do we actually want to try to achieve?
How fast should it progress?
There is complete disarray about the methods for achieving our goals, themselves as yet not even properly defined.
I must ask, Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz, what do we actually expect of the Commission?
The European Union is too small, faced by this global problem, to work out solutions on its own.
We at least need to have the USA on board.
We need to show all industrial nations our determination and to lead by example.
It is our duty to provide an example.
It is our duty to show states which are still undergoing industrial development that there are other ways than the ones we have taken.
These states do not all have to repeat our mistakes.
We need voluntary agreements - my group and I would support that - which would then have to be kept.
According to optimistic assessments eight thousand million people will inhabit this planet in 2050.
Other calculations forecast even higher figures.
If those eight behave then as five do today, our planet is really close to its end.
We have got to act now!
