Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we all know that we have to have an agreement on climate protection and reduction of greenhouse gases, in order to save mankind and the environment.
The essence of the Pimenta report is that we have come out in support of a 15 % reduction by the year 2010, even if Kyoto fails to produce a binding agreement.
Madam Commissioner, I am very disappointed in you.
Did I correctly understand you to say that you do not support these measures?
Is the Commission not prepared to take on a pioneer role?
I think we can only be credible when we make it clear that we - regardless of what emerges from Kyoto - are ready to reduce by 15 % by the year 2010.
If we do not do this we shall be hiding behind those climate killers, the USA and Japan.
I think that would be a declaration of environmental bankruptcy.
It would be a step backwards, were the Commission not to make clear that we want to advance realistically, that we are at last ready to accept that there is a global catastrophe, and that we are taking steps.
I believe the European floods have shown quite clearly that we are not far away from that global catastrophe.
Madam Commissioner, I urge you at long last to take on a vanguard role and to declare that we shall reduce CO2 emissions, so that we place other climate killers under pressure.
