Mr President, my thanks to Mr Linkohr and Mr Pimenta for the reports they have presented on behalf of their two committees.
I attended the Rio follow-up conference in New York as one of two representatives of the European Parliament.
I praised the Commission at that time because it came out in favour of ambitious reduction objectives for Kyoto, even though we have to admit that, in view of what Mr Linkohr rightly said, these can only be a very first step and are not actually enough.
It is what is practical today, though, and for that reason we must support the Commission on this point.
The climate catastrophe will have many devastating effects.
That has already been said.
I would mention one point perhaps deserving of a greater public airing, and that is the effect on health.
Because of the changes in climatic zones we in Europe will become subject to tropical diseases hitherto unknown here.
I believe that when people fear for their own health they perhaps begin to think a bit more deeply.
President Clinton also mentioned this in his speech in New York.
It is most unfortunate that although that speech contained a few good points, the USA had to adopt such a restrictive position.
The reason for it is that industrial lobbyists there are spreading stories of a crisis scenario, a catastrophe scenario, if serious reduction objectives should be decided.
I believe the opposite is the case.
We can give many good reasons for that.
I shall cite one practical example, and everyone there in Kyoto should ask the Americans if they could not put an end to it.
I am frequently told that people in many open-plan offices in the USA wear jerseys in summer because the air-conditioning is badly set.
I do not think it would have anything to do with a reduction in living standards if this were ended by using modern and more efficient technology.
We do not have to go back to the caves, but we must advance to better efficiency.
The Commissioner should do more in this respect.
