Mr President, I asked you four months ago if you would find out how it was possible for the Council presidency to say at the conference in Zimbabwe that Parliament had no view on CITES.
Parliament had in fact passed an urgent resolution, so it did indeed have a view.
That view was available there as well, yet the whole international assembly said that we did not have one.
I have asked here several times how such a thing could be possible, and I insist on getting an answer.
I am slowly beginning to suspect that we increasingly pass resolutions here, which never reach their recipient.
This can only create the impression that our work is pointless, or that it is not taken seriously.
I do not believe either is the case, and it annoys me, for one.
I would ask you now, and I am very much in earnest, to arrange for an answer to be given please, because the matter dates from July and it is now November.
