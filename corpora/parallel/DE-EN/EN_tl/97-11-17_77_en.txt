Mr President, a year and a half ago we stated quite clearly the conditions under which we would agree to a Customs Union, and because of that there has been a long drawn-out concerted action against us.
Now the Council wants to push through regardless an amendment to the basic law, and that without any debate.
We are to be kept retrospectively better informed, as far as Customs Union is concerned.
The concerted action against us was, it seems, just a pilot exercise.
Last year we insisted on being heard beforehand, but now that is all to be pushed aside.
I believe this amendment in favour of article 113 is simply not applicable, and in its opinion the Committee on Legal Affairs even spoke of dangerous prejudice.
Up to now the losers from Customs Union have been small and medium-sized businesses in Turkey, whereas EU exporters have been raking in ever-increasing profits.
This imbalance is ruinous for Turkey.
We have said right from the beginning that Turkey's acceptance path into the Union should not be obstructed.
Turkey must be able to participate as an equal partner in the negotiations for the European Conference.
The prerequisite for that is, however, the democratization of Turkey, respect for human rights and a political solution to the Kurdish problem.
That includes also the cessation of all aggression in northern Iraq.
We shall unfortunately be unable to vote for this report.
