Mr President, the mobility of students and scientists within Europe is still at far too low a level.
Particularly in the field of university education a process of integration should be developed, a process which is permanent and consists of many levels, and which can function without an expensive institutional infrastructure.
Cooperation between higher education establishments is currently hindered by a lack of knowledge about the higher education structure in other countries, about the quality and content of student courses, and above all about examination methods and final examinations.
Evaluation research could contribute here to valuable enlightenment and encourage mobility amongst students and scientists.
Greater mobility and a networked education would bring untold benefits to Europe as an economic entity.
The encouragement of quality assurance and cooperation between centres of higher education, however, can only function on trust.
Any apparently forced marriages, whether they be by the state or by the Community, must be excluded from the outset.
Cultural variety, which is expressed in the diversity of educational systems, must be respected.
The basic concepts of transparency and subsidiarity have particular importance in the context of the autonomy of higher education centres and the maintenance of their unique identities.
At a time when unemployment is first on the agenda of all European institutions, I think it is extremely important that this subject should also include employment policy arguments.
I have in mind, for example, the mutual recognition of diplomas, and the easing of the transition into working life.
