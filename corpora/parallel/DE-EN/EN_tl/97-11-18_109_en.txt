Mr President, ladies and gentlemen in the Chamber and looking at the monitors in the office, Mr BÃ¶ge's report deserves approval.
But I would have liked more for consumers and more for cattle farmers, whose existence has been endangered by failure in key positions.
It is not enough to give emphatical warning of disciplinary action in Item 7 of our decision.
We must name names!
In the case of BSE, the fact is that the very high officials who have escaped unpunished, as the Commission wanted, are not the only people to blame.
The Commission and Council, at least in the case in BSE, have entangled themselves equally in guilt.
I want instruments which do not just make possible the more flexible handling of disciplinary action which the Commission has promised.
Ministers in the Council must also be brought to account, otherwise BSE will soon flourish again in another form!
