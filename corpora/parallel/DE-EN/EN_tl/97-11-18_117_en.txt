Mr President, first may I thank the rapporteur Mr Menrad very heartily.
His understanding and broad vision are reflected in the report.
He has suggested sensible additions, and the agreement in the Social Committee also shows this.
The economy of the European Union presses for a statute on a European public company or a European company.
The Davignon group has done good preparatory work, there is no doubt about that.
Despite differing structures for participation by employees, the Member States can live with the proposals because, first, changes of legal form to evade co-determination are not possible, and secondly, for those Member States in which the employees themselves do not want participation, a null solution is even possible.
Thirdly, if the employees and employers do not reach an agreement, after the negotiation period expires a minimum quota of employee representatives is binding.
Information and consultation of employees are thus ensured.
The minimum quota seems to the rapporteur to be set too low.
In this I would like to support him explicitly.
Likewise, his reference to the need for haste after decades of discussion is surely right, and I also think that the inclusion of the European co-operative associations in the proposal is necessary.
The Commission's task of convincing the Council, Commissioner Flynn, ought to be entirely possible on the basis of the proposals, which really take account of all objections.
I wish you much success in this task, in our interests too, and I thank you in advance.
