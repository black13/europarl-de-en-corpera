Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first I would like to thank Mr Menrad for his proposal, which we as Social Democrats also support.
That it has become a minimum consensus, Mr Menrad, is not your fault, but I think that of the Council of Ministers.
However, I would also like to thank Mr President-in-Office Juncker for making the effort to bring about a compromise at all after many years.
This proposal also states that we want to use the experience from the debate and the results of the European works council.
But that also means, Mr Flynn and Mr Juncker, that we must use the negative experience from the works council directive, for example, with Vilvoorde.
There is a big disproportion in Europe between the opportunities of labour and of capital.
We have waited for 25 years for this opportunity for co-determination to come about, whereas it took only 25 months to put directives about the internal market into effect.
It is also not enough to enable employees to own more share capital.
They must also participate in decision-making.
There I think we agree, Mr Menrad.
The Europe of the internal market, freedom of services and movements of capital even if they are speculative, has become taken for granted.
We need co-determination by employees and trade unions, further development and perhaps harmonization.
The reason that we have not come further today, in my opinion, does not lie in the complicated relationships, the different interests or even the different traditions, but quite clearly in the excessive power of capital.
I would also like to mention that we are happy and satisfied that this directive or consensus was reached together with the trade unions.
I do not think that the Davignon report assesses that correctly.
Finally, two principles.
First, the trade unions must be represented, and second, there must be further development in the direction of true co-determination.
