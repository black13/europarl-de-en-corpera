Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the employment summit will be the yardstick for the social profile of Europe.
The employment profile makes the ills we have to overcome very clear.
Because great successes in the creation of jobs will be thanks not just to labour market policy, but at the same time we need a macro-economic policy which promotes economic growth and does not put brakes on it.
Here there is more to be done.
We should not always be talking only about the deregulation of job markets, their modernization and restructuring, or about people's employability.
We must create economic conditions so that we finally bring the gainfully employed ratio in the European Union close to the Japanese and American ratio of 70 %.
Only that meets our social obligations.
We therefore certainly need a prompt start of currency union, so that monetary policy can play its constructive part at European level.
But we obviously also need coordination of economic policies, and the indescribably indifferent attitude of the finance ministers must be overcome at the European summit in Luxembourg.
We must switch to targets, to reduction of the unemployment rate and redirection to an active job market policy.
But above all we must do more in relation to investment.
Investment is the key.
When I think that job-creating investment in production plant rose by 30 % between 1989 and 1996 in the USA, but by only 5 % in Europe, we can imagine the difference in the employment trend.
I must say that benchmarking for employment and benchmarking for investment must be added to our vocabulary.
This does not only involve pump-priming for private investment, but also redirection of infrastructure investment, public investment, from wasting it on subsidies to employmentoriented public expenditure.
