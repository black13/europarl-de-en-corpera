Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the employment report for 1997 confirms the worsening of the job market situation in many details.
Women's unemployment has risen further, youth unemployment is at 20 %, relaxation is not in sight.
The reasons for the high unemployment lie firstly in the trend of business activity, which continues to be bad, but also in structures which have become rigid, and make it more and more difficult to act nimbly in international competition.
Fair competition within the EU is also made impossible because of the existence of different social and environmental standards in the individual Member States of the EU.
The consequence is that the net growth of jobs in 1996 is entirely due to part-time jobs.
This is a disturbing development, which offers no real solutions, above all for socially weak groups, and above all for women.
Low income, bad social security and low chances of improvement are the start of social impoverishment.
The special Luxembourg summit on employment questions takes place against this background.
A summit which is linked with high expectations, because the Commission has announced the ambitious goal of 12 million jobs.
It is in the nature of things that much is expected of those who promise much, and there will be deep disappointment in the end if these goals are not achieved.
