Mr President, Mr Commissioner, there was something missing from your splendid answer, at least from my point of view.
It was once said - I no longer know by which Asian politician - that landmines are the nuclear bombs of poor nations.
There is some truth in that.
I believe that what it refers to is that the landmines, and the whole situation, which is sometimes difficult to solve, can mostly be traced back to the fact that the two great nuclear powers, Russia and the United States, have done nothing themselves, despite their earlier promises, about nuclear disarmament.
Is the Commission prepared to refer to this question in relation to landmines?
Because as long as there is a nuclear bomb monopoly for two great powers, there will be no disarmament!
