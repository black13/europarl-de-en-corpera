Mr President, privately you can believe what you like, like any of us, but you must not mock us!
You are the representative of the Commission, and what matters is that we should respect human rights in relations with third states.
That is not a job for the Pope, it is a job for the European Union, to put its external relationships, its development relationships to the service of human rights.
Religious freedom is an elementary human right, which you must press for!
What you have said seems to me to be simply mockery of the people who have died or been imprisoned in Cuba for their beliefs!
