Mr President, the question has just been repeated again.
I have already said: If you look at the column on the far left, there is country code today, and then indeed comes 350.
In the column on the right, where the proposals are, it says quite clearly: regional code.
For this reason, we refrained from changing it, because that would have been a political declaration.
But I would like to ask you to take account of what I have said.
It is the same as what is in the letter.
Fine, the letter does not concern you, but it may interest you that we also said clearly in this letter to the Spanish government that this is not a political statement.
It does not mean that we recognize Gibraltar as an independent country.
The fact that the number was assigned to Gibraltar has nothing to do with us, but is a decision of the ITU.
I have already said in the debate that we do not associate any political motivation with it, and I say once again as the answer to your question: We do not take any position in this way to one or the other claim of one of the two countries which cannot agree about this question.
I think that must be enough!
