Mr President, I can really only answer the first part of the question with hope.
I do not know 100 % how things will turn out, but I think that the responsible people have thought about it just as we have.
Perhaps it is easier for us, and that is, if you like, an advantage of neglect.
Everything has two sides.
In the past, we neglected to make 100 % use of the possibilities of electronic data processing - we are now trying to change that - and to that extent we are not now in this fix, because we certainly have available data material which can be brought past the year 2000 in other ways.
That is only a provisional answer.
If the MEP is interested, we will willingly tell him what we ourselves in the Commission have done to solve this problem.
As far as others are concerned, they have been made aware of it.
We have also set up certain research programmes to help to find solutions.
The solutions are there now.
There are two problems.
For one thing, they are expensive.
The software producers expect to be well paid for what they are offering.
For another thing, even if software is used, in some cases experts still have to be involved, and there are not many experts, so that there are bottlenecks, and I must say that it is possible that some companies will not sort out the problem, despite our efforts and their efforts.
Then there is a third group, to which you refer in your second question.
Indeed there are companies, even today, which think it will be all right: it does not affect us, we will get round it somehow.
And that means that there are still companies which have not discovered the problem, and that is alarming.
