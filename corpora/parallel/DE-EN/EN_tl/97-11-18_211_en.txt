Mr Howitt, I can very well share the principle, and I also know that the effect of these programmes was partly very positive, particularly in local communities.
But I also know that if we are unable to administer such programmes properly, afterwards the frustration is greater than the success.
It is not a matter of whether some officials perhaps are not so keen on seeing these programmes, but simply of what the Commission is able to do.
I believe that we must also have some ideas, not only with the PACTE programme, but also with all the article 10 actions, about how we ensure the mobilizing effect of such small projects, but at the same time find administrative forms which do not overstretch us.
There is no point in bravely starting such things and failing in the end because we are unable to ensure the appropriate management.
We therefore check all these things.
As you know, that has nothing to do with the fact that because of the inter-institutional negotiations we are forced to set up programmes where we have budget lines without a legal basis, and therefore we have to investigate again how we can include such programmes in the pilot projects.
I ask you please to understand that the Commission does not now simply make promises, but is really trying to find a system which can ensure responsible execution of such projects, at all levels, the Commission level and the level of the authorities which are carrying them out.
