Mr President, Agenda 2000 makes a distinction, so to speak, between the continuation of structural policy for the 15 Member States, and pre-entry and structural support for new Members States after entry.
What I said, and what Agenda 2000 also ensures in this sense, is that support for objective 1 regions will not be reduced because of the entry of new members, but that the proposal is still two thirds of resources which are increasing in total.
Also, the cohesion fund will continue to be open for Member States which do not exceed 90 % of gross national product.
The half-time check refers to this 90 % and not to future members which enter in the period from 2000 to 2006.
