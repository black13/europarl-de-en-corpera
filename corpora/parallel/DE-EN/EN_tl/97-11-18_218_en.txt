Mr President, I think I can do that quite briefly, because afterwards I shall go into the question again specially.
But the basis for calculating the eligibility for support of the regions is the last three years for which regional data is available.
Our problem is that we must make fixed rules, and however much I understand every individual with his imaginative arguments, I think we would all be in an awful mess if we did not keep to preset criteria.
As far as I can see, the 75 % criterion is mostly undisputed throughout the Community.
