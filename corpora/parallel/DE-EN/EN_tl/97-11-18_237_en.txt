Mr President, let me thank Mrs Jöns for her report.
I agree fully with her assessment, and indeed with the original version of the document, and for this reason I wish to make a number of general comments on the subject of social dialogue.
Of course the latter has a valuable contribution to make.
However, the achievements of the social partners in Europe, whether in respect of career breaks or part-time work, are sadly minimalist in the truest sense of the word.
We cannot be satisfied with this.
For this reason, Mr Commissioner, I do not share the euphoria which has so far surrounded the results of social dialogue.
We have but one foot in the door, and we will have to push much harder if we are to achieve anything.
I hope that we can count on your support here, though I personally am not convinced that your support will prove strong enough.
If we are to be presented for a third time with an agreement of such minimal value, then I believe, with some regret, that we must reject it.
I also wish to express my thanks to Mr Hernández Mollar.
His contribution to the employment summit has been significant and I would like to give it my wholehearted support.
However, I fear, Mr Hernández Mollar, that like the social partners in Luxembourg, the Council will adopt the minimalist approach and the peoples of Europe will ultimately blame us for this, since we in the front line may well have aroused more expectations than the Council is prepared to fulfil.
I only hope that my prophesies in this respect do not come true.
