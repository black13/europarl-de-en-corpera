Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this Parliament's concern for aviation safety goes back to before the crash of a Turkish aircraft in the Dominican Republic in February 1996, which Mrs Schmidbauer has reported on so fully.
Our concern here is now focused on the safety of aircraft from third countries.
We already have adequate regulations to cover aircraft from EU countries, though if I may say from personal experience, there are still some areas requiring definite improvement here.
Like the directive on port state control in the maritime transport sector, we must introduce regulations to ensure that our standards are imposed on third country aircraft wishing to land at EU airports.
We in the European People's Party therefore support the proposal of the rapporteur, which constitutes a major improvement in many areas.
The EPP does however have a problem with one aspect of the proposal.
Can it really be logical to consult the opinions of non-governmental organisations in this connection?
Passengers, people living close to airports, pilots, maintenance services, incident reports - yes, but non-governmental organizations, whatever they may be?
We in the EPP cannot accept this proposal, let me make that absolutely clear.
Pre-flight ramp checks are without doubt the best way to improve safety.
Information exchange and cooperation also constitute a important element.
On top of this, sanctions must of course be available, otherwise the proposed measures will lack the necessary bite.
Some of the proposals contained in the report are excellent.
Publication, for example, is a very important means for ensuring greater transparency in this area.
I would ask the Commission to take a long hard look at Parliaments proposals and not simply to dismiss them from the agenda with the slogan "We are in the process of collaboration' .
There is no doubt that these measures would have a major impact on passenger safety in Europe and beyond.
