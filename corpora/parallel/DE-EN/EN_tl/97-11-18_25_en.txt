Mr President, I refer to line 1426, former Yugoslavia.
You state in the Court of Auditors report that up to July 1997 a total of 1.3 % of the resources which we provided in December 1995 for reconstruction in Yugoslavia had been used.
Two weeks ago, we transferred ECU 100 million for 1997, which were provided for reconstruction, to fisheries and elsewhere, because DG 1a is unable to pay these funds!
I have asked Mr Westendorp to come to the Committee on Budgetary Control next week and explain this fact to us, because we are not getting any detailed information from the Commission about what is going on.
My question to you is this: if you say that your work is for prevention, and if you say that the Commission has shown itself to be capable of learning to respond to your stimuli, how then do you assess the ability of DG 1a to learn something for 1997 or 1998 and following years from the mess of 1996?
