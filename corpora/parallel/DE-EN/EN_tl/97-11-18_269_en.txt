This sort of confusion has happened before.
In committee I have already suggested that we use first names when addressing each other.
Madam President, Madam Commissioner, the previous speaker, Mr Lage, gave us the cue when he said it was all a matter of redistribution.
I am of a quite different opinion and I believe that this is a subject which we must tackle and discuss in detail in the months ahead.
It is something which is going to occupy us for some time to come.
What does economic and social cohesion mean?
To my mind it does not mean the creation of equal living standards, since the socialist model of wealth redistribution has failed in practice.
It is a policy which cannot be implemented.
What we can and should try to do is to create comparable living standards, and I am not just playing at semantics when I say this.
What this wordplay conceals is that we can fully accept the differences which exist within the European Union, and that this actually allows free competition and indeed makes it necessary.
My second comment is that economic and social cohesion is not, and never has been, primarily the responsibility of the European Union, but rather is a matter for the Member States, since the instruments and resources available to the Union can only act as an accessory to the main event.
