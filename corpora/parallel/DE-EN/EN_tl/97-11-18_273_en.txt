Madam President, there is no doubting the fact that economic and social cohesion is a fundamental part of the European Union's policy.
The aim of this cohesion policy is to reduce the inequality which exists between EU regions.
Europe is regarded thus, and solidarity too, but solidarity naturally has its limits - and even rich countries have poverty and structural problems within their boundaries.
Looked at this way, net contributors want to be more than just payers.
They therefore insist that the absolute limits of 1.27 % of GDP below 0.46 %, as far as the budget and structural policy is concerned, should remain as real limits.
In this context the question which arises for me, and probably for others too, is whether a report which covers the period 1994 to 1996 really has to include subject matter relating to the future of the cohesion fund and to the future financing of the Union.
As I have already said, there are still a number of question marks hanging over the whole thing.
In other respects we can accept this report and its contents in full.
Support for SMEs and greater inclusion of private initiatives in EU structural and reform policies should be considered important, particularly when this means the creation and/or preservation of jobs, and consequently a reduction in unemployment levels.
Here Europe really is living not just in abstract solidarity, but in the kind of solidarity which matters to individual job seekers.
On the subject of enlargement, which Mr Izquierdo Collado's report also covered, one can only emphasize that the preparatory phase must be supported by a special financial instrument so that new Member States can really be brought into the European community of nations.
