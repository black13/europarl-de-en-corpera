Madam President, Mr Commissioner, let me first express my sincere thanks to the rapporteur for her presentation, which I hope has helped us make some headway.
In the last part-session we discussed reports dealing with the depiction of women in advertising and with violence against women, and I thought to myself that many women in developing countries would be only too glad to have our problems, rather that the burden which they have to bear.
They still have a very long road to travel.
When we call for women to have their fair share of power, income and so on, we are setting objectives which are still a very long way off indeed.
I would like the Commission to tell us if it is planning short-term measures to promote these objectives, such as moves to improve women's earnings and projects aimed at easing the daily toil of women who are responsible for supporting their families and who are certainly in no position to change their traditional circumstances overnight.
The report again raises the issue of a special committee.
I now ask the Commission to ensure that this committee continues to examine the matters referred to by Mrs Junker and that it does this in close collaboration with the Parliamentary Committee on Development and Cooperation.
I hardly dare express the hope that our amendment, which proposes the participation of Parliament in this committee, will become a reality.
I therefore ask that we cooperate as closely as possible with it so that we can improve the situation and take another step towards the complete achievement of our goals.
What interests me above all, however, are the methods which the Commission is intending to adopt in order really to include those who are suffering hardship in this respect, without using the standards of our society as a yardstick for what we believe to be good for women in developing countries.
