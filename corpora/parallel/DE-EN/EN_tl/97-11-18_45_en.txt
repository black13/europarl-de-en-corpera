Mr President, the vote of no confidence on probation has proved itself.
The Commission has moved, but what is also very important is that the European Parliament has reminded itself of its duties.
In the short history of the European Parliament, there is no precedent for how legislative control was exercised in this case of BSE.
When our chairman said that suddenly there is effort in the Commission, suddenly there is openness, and suddenly there is effort, that has to do with the fact that we in Parliament, through this gentle pressure, but also through insight in the good work of the BSE Committee of Inquiry, have forced the Commission to accept Parliament's demands.
One of these demands was that there should be a separation of the legislative work of the Commission and the control activity.
That happened, but we must not forget that true legislative control starts with Parliament.
I would like to emphasize that what has now happened in the Committee of Inquiry and the Temporary Committee is basically the normal work of a proper parliament.
I therefore ask this Parliament to remember its duties, and to perform the role of Parliament in future less with radical utterances outwards - I say this to my group and also to the Socialist group - and more with consistent demands inwards and consistent work.
Then the Commission will move.
Thanks to Commissioner Fischler, Commissioner Bonino, Mr Reichenbach - it was good work together.
I believe we have all benefitted, and that we all start from the assumption that we will not fall back from the standard we have achieved, and that we will together historically force back this historically unique Council, which is executive and legislative at one and the same time - Montesquieu would turn in his grave - and arrive at normal parliamentary work and lawmaking, where we all have our due responsibilities.
