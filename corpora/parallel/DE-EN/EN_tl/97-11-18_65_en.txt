Mr President, this Parliament is often reproached for acting somewhat irresponsibly.
Against this reproach, which is not always unjustified, it can be said that where it truly has power this Parliament acts responsibly and also achieves something.
We in this committee have achieved something.
We have promises that in future health, the environment and consumer protection will be treated as more important than the other aims of the internal market.
We have promises that our agricultural policy will be changed in such a way that dimensions, quantities and areas are not the most important criteria, but we put our bets on quality, class, health and sustainable economics.
We have also achieved something on democratic politics.
Work in the Commission today is organized differently from a little while ago.
Transparency is something which we have experienced in the last days and weeks.
The relevant legislation will in future take place with the responsible cooperation of Parliament.
At least we hope so, and we hope so at the latest on the basis of the changes of authority which the Treaty of Amsterdam will bring with it.
We have not achieved everything.
We have not really sanctioned any individual responsibilities.
But in this connection we have the promise of the President of the Commission to ensure by a new disciplinary law that in future we shall have an appropriate legal basis if irregular behaviour occurs.
We have no real compensation for the victims, but at least we have starts in the right direction, and we expect that solutions for the future will be found by cooperation between this Parliament, the Commission and the Council.
We have not achieved everything, and therefore we must continue to work together in the coming months, so that the consequences of the BSE scandal are appraised and that we all profit from the work of the two BSE committees.
