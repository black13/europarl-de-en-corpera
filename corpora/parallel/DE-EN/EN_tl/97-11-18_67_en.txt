Mr President, I would like to look at the deficit of political responsibility which has become so clear through this case.
It is quite clear that where economic interests and massive promotion combine with subsidies, outrages are almost compulsory.
There we should fill in the institutional gaps.
One is the absolute demand for parliamentary responsibility for European agricultural policy.
There we will not let go!
The second is political responsibility against officials.
Something has been promised by the Commission, we shall wait and see what comes.
We have established a Commission political responsibility.
That has been good and helpful, and we shall maintain it.
But one point is not fulfilled, and that is the political responsibility of the national governments.
It is a scandal if a government breaks the law, and can actually do it without any political sanction!
Here we, as the European Parliament, must work together more strongly with the national parliaments, particularly the oppositions.
Final point: it is intolerable that such wrong behaviour has no financial consequences!
We must demand that if a government, a state, burdens all the others with such massive costs, these costs can then be demanded back from that government.
This is an absolutely central demand which we shall pursue further!
