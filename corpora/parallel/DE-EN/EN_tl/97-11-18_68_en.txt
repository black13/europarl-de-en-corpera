Mr President, I will try to be brief.
I want to concern myself with what the President-in-Office said here.
That seems to me to be very near the truth.
Mr Boden, you ignore the fact that the Member States have a very poorly developed awareness of Community law, particularly in the case of BSE.
States can declare that they do not think about applying the standard which should be applied to animal meal, for instance.
The Commission has to fall back on lengthy breach of treaty proceedings.
What matters here is that we in Parliament enable the Commission to react faster, to take the appropriate actions for people's health.
It is also necessary, and you said nothing about this, for the veterinary controls within states to be made effective.
In Germany, for instance, they must become independent.
Inspectors have a link there, either an employee relationship or a fee relationship, so that they depend on the slaughterhouses.
What matters here is that we should decide on independent veterinary control, and that must also be put through by Parliament and the Commission.
I would have criticized the Commission much more if I had not heard your speech.
For instance, you mentioned labelling.
The only point on which you were unanimous was the rejection of Parliament and the Commission!
In this matter you have made compromise after compromise, and what came out of it was what the Commission submitted and Parliament's proposals for improvement!
That is a scandal!
Excuse me, Mr President, I would love to speak for ten more minutes, to give the Council a real rocket at last!
