Mr President, what have we learned from the BSE scandal?
We have learned, and the learning was bitter, that he who puts the market before health precautions loses.
We have learned that keeping policies secret behind closed doors or failing to admit mistakes results in people losing trust, and that great damage results, damage of which we can still not say exactly how great it is and how long we shall need to make it good.
But we have also learned that to change can mean to win, that transparency, as we now have it, for instance, in the field of scientific advice, as we want to have much more of it in the initiation of legislation and the decisionmaking process, can instil trust back into people.
We have learned that if we give priority to precautionary health and consumer protection, and if we practise sustainable agriculture in earnest and not just in Sunday speeches, this change can regain people's trust for us.
I would like to thank Commissioner Bonino in particular, and of course her staff.
Mrs Bonino, you have demonstrated just how much really good and important work the right woman in the right place can achieve!
We have learned a great deal.
We shall see how it goes.
We shall look very carefully at the half-yearly progress reports which we discuss in the committees, and we shall check very carefully, Mr President of the Commission, on how the proposal for a new interinstitutional agreement is shaping.
This will be submitted early next year, and we must debate it.
It is very important.
In my opinion, it is the Member States which have learned too little, and the President-in-Office has regrettably shown that again today.
Over 25 years ago, Willy Brandt won an election with the slogan 'Dare more democracy' .
We too must dare more democracy in this Parliament.
