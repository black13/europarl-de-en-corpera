Mr President, I voted against maintaining a cohesion fund in this report because I believe that - should we have monetary union by 1.1.1999 - you can no longer justify subsidizing countries that are not involved in monetary union.
I think it is particularly important in regard to the vital EU enlargement eastwards that we save money here which we urgently need for enlargement in the East, and these ECU 3 billion annually can be very usefully employed for this.
Moreover, I consider it a disadvantage for the future new Member States from central and eastern Europe if we continue to subsidize countries not involved in monetary union while at the same time the new Member States fail to enjoy this cohesion fund.
That is why I have voted against this amendment to maintain a cohesion fund in contrast to the majority of my group.
