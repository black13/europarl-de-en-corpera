Mr President, I really would like to admit to our two rapporteurs that the Treaty of Amsterdam has brought benefits and developments in its wake.
However, historically, we must concede that the governments and leaders of the Member States have failed in the historic dimension insofar as they have not managed to give the European Union of the Fifteen greater decision-making powers, nor have they succeeded in making it capable of enlargement.
That is the historic failure of the governments, not Europe, but the governments.
What we are now faced with, and what I really fear, is a very difficult dilemma, that on the one hand the political situation could develop in such a way that the institutions will not get to be reformed and that, on the other, enlargement will be postponed, or even declared to be impossible, in view of the lack of institutional reform.
This dilemma is the legacy of Amsterdam.
We should admit this quite openly.
The following course seems advisable to me.
The most important point is that we do not let the political discussion about institutional reform peter out.
The European Parliament needs to ensure, together with the national parliaments, that political pressure is maintained in the direction of institutional reform.
If we cannot manage that, then the thing I really fear will be upon us, with the result that neither enlargement nor a consolidation of the European Union will happen.
The reason for us getting into these difficulties still lies in the fact that in reality there is no consensus about the aim of European integration.
That is the original cause of our difficulties.
We need to show commitment to bolster support for the political union publicly, in our own countries, because this is not just a central responsibility, but also the crucial point, if we want to move forward with European integration.
