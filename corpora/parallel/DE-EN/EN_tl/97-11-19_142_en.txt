Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs on their work, although I normally refrain from doing so in principle because of the time.
Although we will not be approving the report, the work involved really does need to be highlighted.
In presenting its arguments, the report objectively shows up the merits and deficiencies in the text of the treaty in a way that could have just as easily borne the famous 'no, although' as the 'yes, but' opted for by the rapporteur for political reasons after controversial debate.
For us independents, alongside the For and Against, the lack of progress in the institutional sphere heard today, reflecting in our view the situation in the Union, there is also the casting vote of 'no, although' .
That is largely because we see this as signalling that the intergovernmental conference has reached its limits, because the citizens of Europe are not prepared under the given circumstances to surrender sovereignty further and because we believe that this phenomenon should be taken seriously.
