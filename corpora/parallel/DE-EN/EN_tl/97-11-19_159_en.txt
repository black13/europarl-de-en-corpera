You should always measure yourself against your opponent.
Who is fighting this Treaty of Amsterdam with the greatest vehemence?
On the one hand, there are the Euro-fundamentalists.
For them the Treaty of Amsterdam does not go far enough.
They want a quicker and more complete move to a European federal state, and this Treaty of Amsterdam is a long way off that.
On the other hand, the Treaty of Amsterdam is being fought by the main opponents of the European Union, who either do not want a common Europe at all or only want a very loose confederation of states, a superior free trade zone of nation states, who can say no to everything.
For such opponents and their arguments the Treaty of Amsterdam cannot be bad at all.
But it could be better.
It could, and should, embrace much broader and deeper institutional reforms if it is to bring about each bit of consolidation needed for the next enlargement of the Union.
We still have a few years yet until enlargement.
We must use this time for further treaty review, which follows other rules than the previous Intergovernmental Conferences.
The previous method of treaty review is out of date.
It leads to veto positions in areas where we need movement.
It leads to the lowest common denominator in areas where we need great - if not the greatest - commonalities.
Which procedure will help us out of this dilemma?
Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo and Mr Tsatsos bring the correct approach to the discussion.
The next treaty review needs to follow European rules of lawmaking.
It must proceed in the way we traditionally make European laws: on the basis of a notice of motion from the Commission and with the legitimate involvement of Parliament and Council.
If we conduct the next review according to these rules, then it will be successful, and then the next treaty will not only fail to prevent enlargement, but actually promote it.
