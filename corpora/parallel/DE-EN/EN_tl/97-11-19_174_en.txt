Mr President, patting each other on the back is the last thing we want in these days before the EU/USA summit.
Because there are a whole lot of issues missing from the new transatlantic agenda that belong in any dialogue committed to the environment and the welfare of the people.
This dialogue, which we undoubtedly need, must be both a critical one and one capable of withstanding criticism among friends.
False friends are no use to anybody.
And right at the top of the list of priorities of the two largest economic blocs in the world should not be the kowtowing to company interests, but rather political guidance in the direction of world peace, socially and ecologically sustainable regulation of the global economy, and equal participation of all countries, especially the weaker ones.
It is also absurd to push for a multilateral trading system under the aegis of the WTO, on the one hand, while pursuing special bilateral paths, on the other, that exclude and disadvantage the rest of the world for the protection of your own economy.
The opposite course would be more appropriate: common concern for greater consumer protection, raising the standard of the existing social environment, and providing better public information.
Preparations for the next WTO Conference of Ministers should also be on the agenda.
Because substantial proposals in the areas of social and environmental standards need to be made early.
Genetically modified soya, hormone-treated beef also need to be banned from our menus according to the WTO text.
The EU should also remind its friends of its homework in Kyoto and Ottawa, where in December the international agreement banning land mines is to be adopted.
Because we have a global responsibility.
We do not need a fortress Europe nor a hegemonic US superpower.
