Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council and Sir Leon Brittan for their report and the insight they have given us.
I believe that over the last few years a lot has been achieved by the work of the Commission in particular.
Good relations between Europe and the United States have provided for freedom, peace, more human rights, stability and prosperity over the last decades.
We need to see to it that this is kept alive in the future, while appreciating too that, because of the new world order, the end to power bloc confrontation, the diminished significance of alliances forged through military threat, the strengthening of the European Union to the point of monetary union, things have changed to such an extent that we need to find new responses to the mechanisms and that NATO alone cannot be relied upon to maintain transatlantic relations.
I think we should see beyond the transatlantic declaration, beyond the transatlantic agenda, to how we might use the momentum from the successful work of recent years to strengthen these relations.
It is precisely the decision in regard to Helms-Burton, the inability of the American President to push fast-track through in Congress, which shows that things will only work if we can bring this together at a political level that also includes the American Congress.
Anything else, I believe, is impossible if we wish to improve relations long term.
I think that is why a transatlantic market-place with clear objectives and a timetable is very important, to maintain the momentum while providing a framework for a treaty which takes in the democratic institutions of the European Union and the United States.
In this way it can be made clear that the common interest is greater than the individual interests which are asserted at times.
