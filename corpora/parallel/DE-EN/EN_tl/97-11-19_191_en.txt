Mr President, there were four problems to be solved if the reform of the European Union envisaged by the Maastricht Treaty was to become a reality: the elimination of the constitutional democratic deficit of a Union from above and of a Europe of the intergovernmental conference; the elimination of the institutional deficit of a Union without legal personality, of dualism, the pillar-and-space structure lacking any single competence to act in the matter of peace and legal policy; the elimination of the legal framework deficit in the confusion of Union, Community and international law; and finally the elimination of the paralyzing lack of clarity as to how future integration and enlargement measures should be carried out to finally overcome the East-West divide in Europe.
It is not a case of denying the partial improvements made to the Maastricht Treaty by Amsterdam when pointing out the lack of a solution still to these fundamental problems.
No-one is going to devalue the efforts of the two rapporteurs on Amsterdam.
But their report remains ambiguous in regard to these fundamental problems and is therefore unacceptable to my group.
In view of the failure of the Intergovernmental Conference it is not so vital whether this House recommends accepting the Amsterdam Treaty or not.
Rather, what is central is whether the European Parliament limits itself to being a proud co-mover of partial institutional reforms or whether it finally rouses itself to become the leading voice in a constitutional process, the heart and nerves of the next crucial steps towards integration!
(Applause from the Green Group)
