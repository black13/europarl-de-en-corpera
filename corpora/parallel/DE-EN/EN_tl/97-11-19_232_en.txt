Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, you know I come from Austria, a country where all nuclear questions are handled very sensitively.
I must confess, to my shame, that I am not familiar with the 92/3/Euratom directive quoted by you.
The question this raises for me, and which is no doubt interesting for many Austrians, concerns the passage of nuclear waste.
Only the Member States of destination are ever referred to.
Would it be possible under this guideline for a country like Austria to practically defend itself against the relevant substances being transported through it?
I am not just talking about the final disposal.
