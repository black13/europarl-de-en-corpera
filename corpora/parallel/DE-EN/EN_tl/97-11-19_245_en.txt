Mr President, I congratulate you on your brilliant response to China.
I would just like to inquire by way of addition: we do not take an uncritical view of American foreign policy, of course, but actually a very critical one.
Yet American foreign policy has done something very positive recently with the appointment of its own Tibetan envoy.
I wanted to ask you whether the European Union is also planning to appoint a similar envoy, or how the question of Tibet is currently being handled in the Council.
