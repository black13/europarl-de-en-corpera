Mr President, it is not the usual problem with Question Time, instead I have something quite concrete today.
For some time we have been receiving the Council's written replies relatively late.
This is the fault of this House, however, because they are issued by the Council in good time as I understand it.
I would therefore request that we get to receive the written replies this week in Strasbourg.
