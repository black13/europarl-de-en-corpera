Mr President, it is absolutely essential to dismantle swiftly the many and varied barriers to a properly functioning single market which still remain.
In this regard I should like to give Mr von Wogau's report my wholehearted support in terms of most of its details, in its basic philosophy and also in its justified reasoning.
As stated in Section 11 of the report particular emphasis should be placed on ensuring that small and medium-sized enterprises play a full part in the single market as there are fears that for various reasons this single market will for a time be an achievement from which big business gains most of the benefits.
However, I cannot subscribe to the opinion expressed in Section 12 - although it is outside the scope of the report, it is mentioned in it - that the single currency is an essential part of the European national market.
In this case I think the wish is father to the thought.
When monetary union takes place on 1 January 1999, there will still be many areas, clearly illustrated in this report, where the single market will not have matured into a national market.
I am rather of the opinion that to ensure a stable and healthy monetary union essential elements of the national market should be implemented before it begins and that the monetary union represents the culmination of the single market.
With regard to the whole matter of transparency and comparability the combination of a uniform currency and an incomplete single market gives rise to fears of distortion of competition.
I am thinking in particular of taxation, standards and the underlying social and environmental situation.
In certain cases I also have serious reservations about the desire to coordinate economic policy.
These tensions could take on such gigantic proportions that instead of fostering integration the euro could contribute to serious political destabilization.
