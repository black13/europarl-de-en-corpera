I should also like to put my question right away as I believe it is too important to be left to one side.
When we talk about standardization we should generally be thinking about the type of reorganization of the standards system we in Europe are striving for.
Time is getting short and if we consider that EUROCODES gave way to CEN in 1989, progress in this area has not exactly been setting the heather on fire.
What we should all be asking ourselves is whether it would be possible to set new standards on a voluntary basis and considering what new standardization options are available to us in any case.
It is also urgently necessary for us to get the EC mark because - as Mr Langen has quite rightly said already - many small and medium-sized enterprises are active in this sector.
If we want to do away with borders, if we want to promote public procurement, then we simply need to operate these principles of product approval, labelling, purchasing, liability and insurance.
