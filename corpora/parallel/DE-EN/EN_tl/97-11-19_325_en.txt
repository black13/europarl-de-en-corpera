With regard to the single market we have seen the problem - and this is what Mr von Wogau was saying - that standardization in Europe is lagging behind.
Deadlines are too long and we quite simply have to ensure that our standardization systems are more market-oriented and operate with shorter deadlines.
The national systems are producing too much resistance.
What we need is a new style of coordination and a new type of organization at European level.
My question is whether the Commission intends to introduce reforms in this area.
