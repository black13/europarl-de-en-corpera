Efficiency through education, that is the motto for the tax system in the single market.
If the single market is to function properly we need qualified civil servants who can also give out the right information.
It is a question of establishing an obligation to provide information and, at the end of the day, a certain degree of liability for the information provided as well.
We know, for example, that various double taxation procedures are causing enormous problems in the European Union.
In this case a good training course for civil servants may be a major prerequisite for the smooth functioning of the single market.
If civil servants had sufficient technical knowledge of the tax system this would be another firm foundation on which to build the harmonization of taxation.
In particular, the improvement of language knowledge and also the training schemes available in this area, for instance Mattheus, is extremely important in order to have an efficient tax administration system in future.
I believe that in future we should concentrate on creating a situation where the people working in this field also act in an advisory capacity and do not just regard businesses as victims but as the basis for the existence of our system.
