Mr President, 1 January 1998 will be another historic date in the European Community.
Liberalization in this sector will bring with it considerable progress and my thanks go particularly to Mr van Velzen who has really worked hard on this issue and has contributed greatly to making this possible.
A few days ago I presented a book about telecommunications in Austria which represented the state of the art in Austria.
The interest it generated was huge.
Entirely new business opportunities are available in this sector and I believe this is of great significance for our future as well as for employment.
As far as the numbers are concerned it is very important that the number should also be a trade mark.
We can see this in the emergency number 112, and perhaps 388 will be the code for Europe.
In future we should give much more consideration to what impetus for rationalization we could trigger using numbers like these, as well as considering the cost of change.
I believe an analysis of the most frequently dialled numbers would be a giant step forward for us.
