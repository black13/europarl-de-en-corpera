Of course the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy must be very disappointed - to put it mildly - that no energy chapter has been included in the treaty, especially if you consider that energy will be a priority in the internal politics of Agenda 2000.
We now have the single market for energy, after all.
And, of course, you have to criticize the fact that Euratom has been totally overlooked too.
The issue here has nothing to do with Safeguard, but the entire nuclear industry, and in this area Parliament has absolutely no participation rights, a fact we deplore and are constantly complaining about.
All that happens is we are kept informed - and this in an area of policy that provokes very different reactions in all the Member States!
We would have, therefore, found it very beneficial - and we must continue to insist on this - if these two key policy areas which we are all so dependent upon had been incorporated into the treaty.
It is becoming urgently necessary that Parliament receives full participation rights here and that we do not just have the appropriate funds at our disposal.
Otherwise, democratic control is impossible, and without democratic control there can be no acceptance and still less any credibility.
