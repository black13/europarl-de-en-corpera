Mr President, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that Amendment No 45, which we introduced, should read in the second part of the German version: ' advocates maintaining a cohesion fund' and not, as was incorrectly translated, ' demands for its part the maintenance of a cohesion fund' .
It is a very important point that the words are reproduced exactly as I uttered them, or else there are likely to be problems.
The discussion in the groups and in the Committee was very intense.
It is important to have the same, correct version in all languages.
