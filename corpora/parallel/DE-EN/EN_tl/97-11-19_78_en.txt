Mr President, I would like to point out that at this point the first part of the original text should be taken, and this reads: ' advocates maintaining a cohesion fund' .
This is the common text which was discussed by everyone.
Now the translation of what my colleague Mr Izquierdo Collado said into German was still such that there could have been some ambiguity.
I insist that this wording 'advocates maintaining a cohesion fund' is correct in the second part.
