All experience with dictatorships and civil wars in the east, the west and the south, whether in the former Soviet Union or in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Chile or today in Algeria, teaches us one thing: war criminals and crimes against humanity must be prosecuted by the criminal law.
Immunity from prosecution is an invitation to further crimes and prosecution has a huge preventive function.
For that reason my group has for years supported the establishment of an international criminal court.
I should like to draw your attention, Commissioner van den Broek, to Figure 3 of our joint resolution, which deals with finance.
Two years ago in this House I talked myself hoarse in order to obtain ECU 3 million for the financing of the Criminal Courts in Yugoslavia and Ruanda.
This year we have been able with rather less effort to insert ECU 3 million into the budget.
I should be grateful to the Commission if it were to develop with us in future a system of financing, so as to secure the long-term finances of such an International Criminal Court.
