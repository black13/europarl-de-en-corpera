Thank you very much Madam President.
I am very pleased to be able to bring you good news on this day, for once.
We have just received a communique about our resolution concerning the Slovak Government's measures against the Slovak press.
The Slovak Parliament has resolved largely to reject these measures or so to rephrase them, that we have the impression that a real battle for press freedom in Slovakia has been won here.
This is of great significance because it shows yet again that, if one really confronts a matter, one is successful.
That is our good fortune, because the Slovaks are one of the most likeable races in Europe.
They are good people who have suffered a great deal throughout their history, and yet still believe in their faith and their homeland.
Today they have a Prime Minister who follows a most unfortunate policy and, particularly with regard to minorities, behaves in a manner which we cannot in any way countenance.
That is why Slovakia has fallen behind in its negotiations with the European Union, although things would doubtless have gone better under a better Prime Minister.
This development at least shows that we are progressing in the right direction, and we can say that we no longer need this resolution.
As a result of our experience with Mr Meciar, however, we should restore the matter at once, were the Parliament's resolution not to be obeyed.
Let that be sign of good faith on our part.
At the same time, it should be a signal to the Slovak people that if policies which accord with our standards are followed there, the door to European Union stands wide open for Slovakia.
As a result, at least speaking on behalf of the first signatory sitting next to me, my son, may I say that we withdraw this resolution, but with the thought that should Mr Meciar not abide by his parliament's resolution, our resolution will be reintroduced in December.
