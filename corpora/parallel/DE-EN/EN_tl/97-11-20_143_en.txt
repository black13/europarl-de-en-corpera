Madam President, I can only agree with the previous speaker.
I am almost embarrassed to face Mrs Thors, because I always thought I was the hardliner here, and now she is clearly a harder hardliner than I am.
I think it is good news which we have just received and we should bear in mind the fact that the full delegation will be meeting next week with the Slovaks.
Having had good news we now hope that it proves to be true and that the delegation will get the opportunity over the next few weeks to debate it.
I also think we should reserve our position to return even more firmly to this point next month, should the news prove not to be true.
On this occasion, however, I should like to say on behalf of my group that we shall withhold our signatures and also vote accordingly.
