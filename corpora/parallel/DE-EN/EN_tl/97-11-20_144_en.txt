Madam President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is interesting to see what is taking place out in the Philippines.
There is a Ministry of Land Reform - the European Union has participated since 1986 in this programme to the tune of tens of millions - yet the local Minister has nothing better to do than to redistribute back to large landowners land already given to the farmers.
Simultaneously one of the farmers' leaders, one Romeo Cortez, and Gaudencio Devaras, chairman of a community, have been kidnapped by the military.
The farmers were successful in using a hunger strike to get President Ramos to return the land to them on this occasion.
We must press the Commission to demand coherent policies in the Philippines.
I can tell you from my own experience working with landless farmers in Brazil, that a country can very quickly deteriorate in this way, or even be driven into civil war.
We can see that in Columbia.
Such conflicts are very vicious and we must insist that, if we are to participate with money, an end is put to this situation.
