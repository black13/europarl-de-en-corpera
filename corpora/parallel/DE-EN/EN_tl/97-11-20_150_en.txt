Madam President, I should naturally like to thank the author, Mr Dupuis, and also Mr Newens, for the fact that they particularly mentioned settlement policy in this region.
I think there is a big problem here, which is manifest not just in this area but in many.
This is that the original inhabitants have a real right to their land; that is their culture, their life, the whole core of their existence, and just because they have no piece of paper to certify this current Bangladeshi law says that only those possessing such a piece of paper has a right to own land.
In most cases those will be settlers who arrive later.
In 1947 there were about 10, 000 settlers there who had not originated directly from the Chittagong Hills Tracts.
In 1977 there were about 100, 000, and today the number already runs into seven figures.
It is clear from this that a huge policy is being pursued in this direction, such that we actually have to say that it conflicts with basic human rights and that we as the European Parliament, which invests a great deal in Bangladesh, have got to make a clear statement in support of the Jumma people 's rights.
