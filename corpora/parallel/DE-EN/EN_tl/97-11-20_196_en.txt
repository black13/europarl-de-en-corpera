Madam President.
First let me thank Mrs Jöns most sincerely for her report.
The Group of the European People's Party voted against this report in committee.
These points were, however, removed or at least blunted by compromise solutions.
As a result I am not entirely happy, but at least the report now seems to be capable of receiving my vote.
One point worries me.
We now have different percentages, Mrs Jöns, for the reserves, for the payment rates, for the ESF as opposed to the ERDF.
That will make the Commission's work more difficult in future.
I think that it is inadvisable for Parliament to use different data for two funds.
I believe the expenditure of the ESF will in future be more important and have greater coverage.
Up to now the ESF has been partly successful, but there was a part which was less so.
I must admit, however, that assessment of the various measures was difficult.
Nevertheless, the results must in future be better balanced and be presented more quickly, in my opinion, so that conclusions can be drawn without delay.
The ESF will certainly become more important because of increasing globalization.
That is why I accept cofinancing so that the funds, which are essentially too small for 15 countries, can be increased.
Subsidies of 70 % or even 90 % must remain the exception, or we shall be unable to increase the funds substantially.
Finally I should draw urgent attention to the fact that the ESF must look more to rural areas and their populations, rather than conurbations.
In my view, rural areas will otherwise become yet more depopulated, and we know the result of that.
Conurbations increase in size, and we must avoid the results of that - increased costs, more problems - by use of the ESF.
