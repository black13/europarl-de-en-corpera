Mr President, corruption threatens society, organized crime threatens society.
Added dangers accrue, therefore, from the interplay between corruption and organized crime.
We in the Freedom Party have always made a stand against corruption of any kind in Austria.
We have made a name for ourselves for that.
So we basically welcome the action plan - I do especially in my capacity as a judge in the criminal court - but most particularly the initiative to create throughout the Union a criminal code to combat active and passive bribery, even within private commercial activities.
International development and the annual report on fraud make quite clear the need for relevant regulations within the criminal codes of Member States, and for international prosecution procedures.
We do have ideological reservations, however, on the indictment of artificial persons and in contrast to Mr Bontempi we believe that for democratic reasons a treaty between nations would be preferable.
