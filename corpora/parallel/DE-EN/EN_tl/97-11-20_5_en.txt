Mr President, The Committee on External Economic Relations requests that you reject the urgency application.
The Commission asked on 17 November for an urgent priority according to article 97.
The Committee on External Economic Relations debated the application at a session on 18 November, and rejected it unanimously on grounds both of procedure and content.
The following concerns the procedure followed.
At the time of the application for urgent priority the Committee was in possession only of a copy of the covering sheet to the basic document containing the Commission's proposal.
Under such circumstances we cannot be expected to give a Commission proposal serious consideration, however urgent it may appear to be.
Despite this, it would be possible to make an exception for the Ukraine on financial grounds, but as a tranche of ECU 100 million was to be made available, we do not believe that it was not capable of rejection on financial grounds alone.
We need time for consultation and request the rejection of the urgency application.
(Parliament rejected the request)
