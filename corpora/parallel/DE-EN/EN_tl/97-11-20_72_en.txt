Madam President, thank you for rejecting the amendment by Mr Dupuis.
The amendments by the Group of the European Radical Alliance in any case follow a completely different path from Mr Orlando's.
But before we vote I would again like to raise the question of the many linguistic corrections.
There is a reason for this.
The Council was kind enough to send us these texts for consultation in advance of the Amsterdam Treaty, but with a very short deadline, which posed a considerable time problem for the numerous translations.
But when the Council then did what followed, there was no way of coping.
First, it sent us a text.
We are very thorough in our consultation procedure, but in the meantime the Council amended its own text without consulting us or waiting for our views.
That is an impossible procedure.
Parliament really cannot be treated like that.
I must ask therefore ask the President to report to the thunderous applause of this House to the Council.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
