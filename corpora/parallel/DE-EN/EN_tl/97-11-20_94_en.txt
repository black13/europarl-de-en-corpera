Mr commissioner, thank you for your report.
We are of course very happy that it at least appears as though the current crisis has been avoided, even though it would be an overestimate of Europe and the European Parliament to assume that the effect of today's session was so great that Saddam reacted to it.
I do think, though, that a number of questions remain to be answered, not just the fundamental questions you posed, Mr Commissioner.
Firstly, is it your opinion, Mr Commissioner, that the necessary unified European position in this crisis could have been established quickly enough?
I am aware that that is not the job of the Commission or of the Commissioner, but I should still like to ask if you, as a Commissioner, could assume a common European line during all your discussions and efforts.
Secondly, how much, in your view, has the current crisis in Iraq to do with the situation in Israel?
Is the impression correct, which you also may have gained, that the necessary solidarity within the Arabian area itself was not forthcoming because of the Israeli crisis and the opinion of many Arab countries that America had applied too little pressure in the days leading up to the crisis?
The third point that causes me and all of us particular anxiety is obviously the humanitarian aspect.
However unacceptable this Group - and, I believe, all in this House - perceive Saddam's actions to be, just as it is not acceptable that monitoring controls were not good or effective enough, so too do we fear that humanitarian aspects, particularly those concerning children and health problems, are suffering very much under these sanctions.
I should like to ask you if it is your impression that essential humanitarian aspects have been included in the programme of oil in exchange for food, which you mentioned.
Or should not indeed greater essential humanitarian aid have been forthcoming?
