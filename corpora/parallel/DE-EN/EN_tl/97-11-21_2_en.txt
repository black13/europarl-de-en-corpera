Madam President, just a brief statement.
It is about the Minutes from the day before yesterday.
I apologize, but so as not to trouble our colleagues, Mr Pirker and I handed in a written note at the front during the vote to the effect that our voting machines were not working during the vote on the climate conference.
I reported this at the front.
I was told it would be recorded but it has not been recorded.
I would ask for clarification as otherwise I will not be able to sort these things out in writing but will have to rise to speak as some other colleagues have, but that takes up a lot of time.
