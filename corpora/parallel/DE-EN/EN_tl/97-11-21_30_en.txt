Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I think we really have to get down to brass tacks here.
In fact, what it is all about is the development of an industry which is of great significance for the future and constitutes in its variety and diversity what distinguishes the European Union from the other large blocks that exist in the world: its diversity, its variety and its creativity.
It is therefore important that the Guarantee Fund should take account of the minority languages and small-scale productions.
Small productions, Mrs Junker, do not necessarily have to be an unmarketable investment.
That is an issue which has to be addressed at the same time.
Of course we need coproduction, of course we need promotion and of course we need the guarantee fund, because that is the instrument which is potentially viable and effective now, while many other decisions have fallen by the wayside.
In my opinion we also have to address the Member States like Germany which are keeping their feet on the brakes in this respect.
It is not right for a country to maintain that it leads the way in European development and then put a block on all the major portfolios.
Employment policy, audiovisual policy, the list is endless.
This has to be tackled.
