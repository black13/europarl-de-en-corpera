Madam President, I wanted to ask the Commissioner another question.
If the improved quality of the European film market is supposed to win back market share for the Europeans - and we have heard about the order of magnitude involved today - will ECU 20 million bring about a reversal of the trend?
How would you assess the situation?
From a financial point of view, does the order of magnitude involved not make this a token gesture?
What can you actually do with 30 million to bring about the reversal of the trend in film production?
Can you tell me what your experience is in this regard, your assessment of the situation?
