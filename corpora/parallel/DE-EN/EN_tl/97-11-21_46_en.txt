Madam President, first allow me to say a few words to Mr Ripa di Meana who has told us that he takes a very environmentally-sound position in response to this type of question.
I was therefore rather disappointed when he approached this report from a purely statistical point of view and only talked about quotas.
I believe this report deals with an extremely emotive subject because we simply must not forget that both the Arctic and the Antarctic, just like the rain forests to which Mr Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler is constantly referring, are fundamental elements for maintaining the overall ecological balance on this planet.
Thank God the Commission has slowly begun, to a certain extent, to regulate fishing in the Arctic from an environmental starting point in order to conserve living marine resources.
For one thing we should not forget that the further north and south we go from the equator, the slower is nature's ability to regenerate.
Anyone who has been in the Arctic or Antarctic and seen the way dead fish and other dead animals can lie around for years before they rot away, anyone who has seen vehicle tracks there or an oil drum lying around and how many years, how many decades they remain there, will know that we are discussing a highly emotive issue, an issue which we cannot simply sweep under the carpet.
The themes addressed here, in particular illegal fishing, are of vital concern to us.
We must make an all-out effort right from the start to put a stop to this even though we know it is very difficult.
For this reason I am actually delighted that the report and the Commission's proposals are going at a relatively tough pace.
I would hope that these words will be followed by actual deeds.
