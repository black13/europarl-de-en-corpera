Mr President, I know my way around Guinea-Bissau quite well and am very impressed by my friend Mr Imaz San Miguel's report.
I am sorry to have to say that I had some reservations when I read it.
Although I voted for it I am not completely happy with it as fishing is the mainstay of life for the people of Guinea-Bissau.
The way in which the quotas have been determined creates the risk that in fact overfishing will result.
Although it is a good thing that quotas have been established, there were none before.
At that time the people lived mostly from fishing.
I remember people telling me that you could catch enough fish in two minutes to feed a whole family.
Today that is no longer the case and I should very much like to ask people to be very careful after two years, now that everything is to run for four years.
