Madam President, I should like to make a short statement concerning my report.
Those who were present during the debate last night will have heard why the Commission is not prepared to accept the draft amendments relating to the Treaty of Amsterdam which have now been adopted by the Christian Democrats.
I should like to state again quite clearly that my group has not given its assent to these draft amendments because the treaty has not yet been ratified and we cannot refer back to it.
It is a pity that they have now been included in the report because that is what the majority wanted.
But we have to go along with it.
It has happened.
However I should again like to stress that my group cannot accept a situation where we are referring back to something that is not yet in force.
