Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, from an economic point of view Slovakia is not one of the strongest applicant countries.
It quickly overcame the difficulties of its separation from the former Czechoslovakia.
The high economic per capita growth, the fall in the unemployment rate, the inflation rate and the foreign debt, which compared to other countries is low, are impressive elements in this.
Politically the constitutional framework for democratically constituted and effectively operating institutions has already been in place for some years.
But one institution, the government, and for this Prime Minister Meciar and some of his ministers bear the major responsibility, is not working in the way that one might expect in a constitutional state.
His attitude to the role of the State President, his disregard of the decision of the constitutional court, the partial exclusion of the parliamentary opposition from important decision-making bodies and his treatment of the Hungarian minority are important proof of his hitherto antidemocratic attitude.
On the other hand the Slovakian administration and the Parliament are in the process of adapting the relevant legislative areas quickly to the Community law of possession.
The recommendations of the joint EU-Slovakia Parliamentary Committee about which my colleague RÃ¼big will speak later, have set some things in motion.
All in all, however, we find that the Slovakian government does not meet all the political criteria of Copenhagen and great efforts on the part of the Government and in particular of the Prime Minister are still needed to achieve more democratic practice and constitutionality in order to be given a place in the group of candidates to be taken seriously.
