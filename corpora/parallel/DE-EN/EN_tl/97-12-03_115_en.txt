Mr President, in December 1997 the future of Europe will begin.
Ultimately this is only an opportunity to be allowed to live in the future in peace, prosperity and security.
We see that opening up of the east has accelerated the economy, that mutual relationships have become very much closer, that trade will profit, that both sides are profiting from this opening up.
My first concern - and I come from a blacksmith's forge in Austria - about the opening up of the east was, what does the future hold for us?
I went over to these countries and saw for myself the opportunities which exist there.
If one sees the demand which prevails there for products, for services, what all these things can do for us, then that is twice the opportunity.
I believe we must place these opportunities which this eastward enlargement gives us at the centre of our policy, although we must also not forget the risks.
But it is above all an opportunity because of course market restrictions disappear and globalization has a positive effect.
We cannot on Sunday talk about jobs and on Monday be against eastward enlargement.
I believe that eastward enlargement will create jobs on both sides.
This is a chance we must take!
In particular, security considerations such as Schengen, nuclear safety, are also absolutely central issues for us and I believe that in future we shall also in this sphere still have a great deal to do.
As vice-chairman of the Delegation for Slovakia, it is my concern to say that very probably enormous progress has been made and in particular we should see that the opposition became more deeply involved, but that also on the other hand the Gaulieder case is not yet solved, but will be solved next year at the latest with the Elections.
Therefore we should not here choose the formula minus one but plus one.
That is a very important aspect.
I would like to say: the door is open, but we are not forcing our way in!
