Mr President, long term financial planning must also take into particular account the border regions along the present-day external EU frontiers.
Not only the applicant countries themselves but also their neighbouring regions ought to be prepared for the eastward enlargement.
Negative consequences, which could result from the anticipated distortion of competition, must be prevented by a specific support system.
We must provide our own border country support which complements our support for the applicant countries.
In the regions of Austria's very long EU border the citizens have justified fears of economic disadvantages which might arise because of the eastward enlargement.
This is an extraordinarily sensitive question which must not be disregarded during overall planning of enlargement and in the reforms of the agricultural and structural spheres.
Eastward enlargement must not create winners and losers.
The concept of cohesion must in this connection be given a new dimension.
Another essential point which in connection with the planned reforms must not be allowed to drop is the preservation of the rural Alpine area.
This landscape formed and given a special character over many centuries by farming is threatened with economic ruin and emigration.
The current agricultural policy is not applicable to the higher Alpine regions and 5b support is not being continued.
Farmers in the Alpine valleys form the backbone of the economic and cultural life of large areas in some Member States, including above all Austria.
This section of the population must not become the victim of an agricultural and structural policy which applies totally inappropriate standards.
It is therefore absolutely necessary with regard to the maintenance of cultural and scenic diversity and to the strengthening of farming jobs in the Alps, to set up in this region their own target area.
