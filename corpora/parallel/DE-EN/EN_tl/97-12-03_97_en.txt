Mr President, I would like to support our colleague Mr Samland's appeal for honesty and add three aspects to it.
First, as Elmar Brok has just said, it would really be a scandal if a country which already meets the criteria and a Member State of the European Union imposes a veto until its candidate for entry is ready.
Mr Brok knows what I am talking about, I am referring to Poland.
That must not happen!
Second point: the reform of the institutions.
I cannot get rid of the suspicion that many people address the reform of the institutions with the ulterior motive of using it to postpone enlargement for a while.
Therefore we must be on our guard to ensure that the institutional reform is tackled quickly and logically so that we do not waste any time and the enlargement process is not thereby delayed.
A third point, which is also not very straightforward: I have the impression that several countries who are now doing particularly well out of the support system, have no interest whatsoever in enlargement because they will then lose their financial privileges.
That too must not happen.
In these points we need a great deal of honesty and political logic, and I hope that we can really manage this, at least here in the European Parliament!
