Madame President, Mr Bonde clearly wrote his explanation before the vote.
Today was a great day for the Parliament, because the heaven and hell strategy of the Commission has foundered, namely the idea of raising five countries into heaven and banishing five to hell, although all ten - including the EU itself - belong in the purgatory of profound political and economic reforms.
Therefore we have put on blinkers.
We want a flexible procedure, because in these countries nobody knows how the weightings will change politically and economically in the year-long process of application for membership.
There would be no point, as it were, in issuing reports at the beginning of the school year.
That discourages those who get good grades and those who get bad grades: the one believes he already has the situation in his pocket; the other believes that there is no point in making any effort.
We want a process of application for membership which is, as it were, open as far as the results are concerned and which includes all applicant countries.
This is what Parliament today declared with a large majority to be the will of the European peoples, and I appeal to the governments to join them in this.
