Mr President, without wanting to get into the substance of the debate, which would mean my getting slightly bitter, please allow me to point out that I heard this afternoon from Mrs Bonino that she is assuming she will issue a statement tomorrow evening after the Commission has met.
I gathered from the agenda that this statement will take place tomorrow evening at 9.00 p.m., here in this House, followed by a debate on the issue.
I was proceeding from this assumption until two minutes ago, and Mrs Bonino is proceeding from this assumption too.
