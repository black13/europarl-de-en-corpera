Mr President, I do not intend to get involved in the debate.
I would just like to say something about procedure and congratulate the Conference of Presidents on its wisdom.
Last month, in November, we adopted a far-reaching resolution with very few omissions in it.
To do so again this month would not be sensible in my view.
I would ask those colleagues who deem this necessary to consider the fact that in February we will be debating the next Commission report - the first of the half-yearly reports - and will have to come to a decision on that.
That is to say, in the space of just three months, we will have more BSE resolutions to adopt.
I think that will be fun enough, so we can afford ourselves the luxury tomorrow of having a discussion that will provide us with the necessary information.
This way we can save ourselves having to detail a resolution considering the Commission's report in February.
