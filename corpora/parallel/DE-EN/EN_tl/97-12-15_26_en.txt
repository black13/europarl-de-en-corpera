Mr President, I indicated my desire to speak at the start.
Forgive me if I do not comment on the question of British beef.
I do not want to join Mrs Roth-Behrendt in congratulating the Conference of Presidents; on the contrary!
Tomorrow the Committee on External Economic Relations will meet, chaired by Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan.
Given the subject under discussion, it should be a matter of urgency this week.
We are now obliged to make this an informal meeting without the involvement of interpreters.
I merely wanted to protest that, while each working party and intergroup can meet here under sensible conditions, a committee discussing the sort of important matters that need to be dealt with this week, cannot!
I would ask that this way of organizing things cease.
