Mr President, on behalf of the European People's Party may I again welcome the Commission's Green Paper and congratulate Mr Andersson on his factual and well-balanced report.
The object is to improve the competitiveness of the European economy and, with it, the employment situation.
There are new aspects to be found in the present Green Paper and the report: with regard to the site discussion, for instance, it says that we should not just conduct a cost debate on this issue.
Europe cannot compete in the world in terms of wages, but ultimately only on productivity.
This presupposes an increase in motivation, and associated with that new forms of remuneration, changes to job organization, improvement in qualifications and life-long study.
I was very pleased that Mr Andersson refers in clause 19 to promoting worker profit-sharing.
I would like to go a step further and make a connection with greater mobility in pay policy.
Finally, I want to go into a much discussed issue.
Of course, management decides on the introduction of new forms of organization.
However, I agree with the report from the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment when it calls for worker participation in decision-making.
There are three reasons for this.
Firstly, group work that goes against the will of the workers cannot function well.
Secondly, new technologies and organizational forms should not be introduced all at once, but only after the workers have been properly informed and consulted.
Thirdly, if workers' experiences from their present working environment are drawn on, then this will improve company productivity.
That is why, for me, the title of the Green Paper is also the programme: a new organization in the spirit of partnership.
Our companies need better forms of job organization, in the interest of increased employment too, and these need to be created in partnership.
In this sense we endorse Mr Andersson's report.
