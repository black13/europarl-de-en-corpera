Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, reposting is surely an aspect of the practice of dumping.
It is accepted wisdom that you do not get rid of dumping by having the parties concerned sit round the table to conclude a gentlemen's agreement, because this does not work.
What you need is a regulation to eradicate dumping.
To achieve fair competition you need binding rules, and these rules need to go further in the single market than the situation we have with the old type of international postal agreement, so to speak.
Hence there is the need for a directive.
There is the need for control, Mr Bangemann, and it comforts me to hear you say that your notice is only intended to make the directive tangible and capable of being implemented.
Yet why is the directive not taken as the basis for clarifying how the rules of competition should be interpreted in this area?
This is not clear to me in your reply.
