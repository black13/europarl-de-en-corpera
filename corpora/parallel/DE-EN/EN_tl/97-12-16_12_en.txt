Madam President, thank you first of all for what you have said by way of an explanation.
Secondly, I would like to state for the benefit of the ladies and gentlemen who have put these questions with the House's approval that there is a host of subsequent duties incumbent on a former President, a great number of requests and appeals, which have to do with how the presidency has been publicly received in the past.
For occasions such as these I had an official car placed at my disposal.
Every one of you who has ever seen me here in Strasbourg and in Brussels knows that I do not have an official car available, rather I queue along with those waiting for a normal car in the evening, as any other honourable Member would do.
That as an MEP I have a car at my disposal is not true, and anyone maintaining that is lying!
(Applause)
