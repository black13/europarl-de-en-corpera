Madam President, I was not commenting on Mr Hänsch's case.
I made a clear-cut enquiry, and you failed to understand it.
I asked you to tell me which of Mr Hänsch's predecessors made the same suggestion to the Bureau, of having an official car placed at their disposal for several months or years, no more and no less!
I asked whether it was Mr Barón Crespo, or whether it was Lord Plumb, or whoever.
I did not enquire at all about Mr Hänsch.
I would like to know who, apart from Mr Hänsch, made the request of the Bureau.
I would like an answer on this.
