Madam President, first of all, the Presidency Minutes are sent to every Member.
That is why every Member with eyes and ears has been able to read what the Presidency resolved in this matter.
There is, therefore, nothing surprising about what we are dealing with here.
Secondly, this is a general resolution affecting all Presidents of this House.
Thirdly, as regards unusual, Mrs Pack, what is being practised here is no different from what all presidents or speakers of the 15 national parliaments are entitled to.
Fourthly, this Parliament should not diminish itself.
It should be proud that Presidents of this Parliament can appear and deliver speeches in other Member States, that they represent the interests of this House and not the interests of a political group.
That is why, fifthly, I find it shameful that a debate is being conducted here about the President who has represented this House in a way that not many other Presidents have managed to do!
