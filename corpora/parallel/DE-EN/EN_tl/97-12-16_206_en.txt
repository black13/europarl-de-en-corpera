Mr President, I have no supplementary question.
I enjoyed my one question in question time.
However, since you are giving me the floor, I might be permitted a comment.
I am far from criticizing the way you conduct your office.
Only, when we have so many questions to the Commissioner -and I have been waiting for months now, Mr Kinnock, to put a question myself - then it is bad if you permit too many supplementaries, because it is entirely up to you how many you allow.
This means, therefore, that I will not get another chance today and must wait another three months.
