Mr President, when we talk about the energy policy goals of the Community, I think of Fontane.
It is a broad field, and I must add that it is in thick fog, because we have no uniform energy policy goals.
I can make this clear to you with a few examples.
We always say that we must definitely become less dependent on imports.
Then the example of the nuclear industry is given, and everyone forgets that of course we must import the uranium for that.
We always talk about energy efficiency, but we do exactly the opposite.
I would just remind you of the Save programme.
We always talk about renewable energy.
I would just remind you of the Altener programme.
It has been cut to ECU 22 million for two years, which is ridiculous when we have paid ECU 250 million per year for 15 years for fusion.
We also talk about renewable energy creating many jobs, and being good for the environment, but nothing happens.
What we need in the end is an energy tax.
What we need in the end is renewable energy, energy efficiency.
In the end we must use all possible means to continue to develop these.
We cannot do that with the pittance left over because everything is going into fusion.
We also urgently need codecision by the European Parliament, and furthermore we must have a separate energy chapter at last.
We have none of that.
So I can only conclude with the words of Brecht: the circumstances are not right, because the Council blocks everything, and as long as that continues we will have no energy policy goals, but go on sprinkling a little everywhere with the watering-can, and putting all our money into fusion, when all we know about it is that it may produce energy in the year 2080 or 2050 at the earliest.
