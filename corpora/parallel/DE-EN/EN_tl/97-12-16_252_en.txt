Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first I would like to thank Mr Sindal, because he said clearly that prolongation is right, and I am not going to say much about that, but let us come to the point.
We agree.
As long as the USA does not ratify the OECD agreement about eliminating order-related shipbuilding subsidies, preventing its implementation, we must ensure that the shipyards in our Community have at least half a chance against the highly subsidized shipyards in Asia, as well as other shipyards around us.
But we must take care that, if we decide on a common upper limit with the prolongation, the Member States make use of it, so that we do not have support in one Member State but not in another, because then we have a new distortion of competition within the Union.
I also share Mr Sindal's ideas about the debate should the USA still fail to ratify the OECD agreement.
I find the Commission's idea of submitting our own subsidy regime correct in principle, but we should check it very carefully.
Yes, Mr Karel van Miert, we both know that; we must be careful, subsidies must always be for a limited period, and they must be degressive.
Those are the first two principles.
Let me also mention two more principles.
We must take care that the so-called investment subsidies which are to be newly created are not mixed, linked or duplicated with the subsidies for research and development.
Second, we must take care that the investment subsidies are not linked to the traditional support areas of regional aid.
Then of course some shipyards would drop out although they are much more competitive than others.
Their chances would be reduced.
We must take this up with the shipbuilding sector.
Third, we must take care that the support rates in the Union are as uniform as possible, to prevent further distortions within the Union.
There will certainly be an exciting debate about this in the next year.
