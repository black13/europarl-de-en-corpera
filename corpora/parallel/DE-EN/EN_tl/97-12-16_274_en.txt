Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are discussing a proposal by the Commission to make an addition to article 3 of the EC Treaty.
According to it, the activity of the Community should include a contribution to supporting services which are oriented to the common good.
In my assessment, that is dangerous for integration and competition policy, and in my opinion it must be rejected.
Writing it into the treaty would mean that state services of general interest would represent a dimension to which it would no longer be possible to set any limit.
Such an article would also have an effect on the Community's competition rules and regulations, and also on the subsidy regulations, and in contrast to EU policy, which is based on opening up markets and privatization, this is the establishment of monopolies and preferential treatment of public companies, which cannot be in the interests of Europe.
We should ask ourselves what really belongs in state services of general interest.
I think, as little as possible.
In my opinion, the state must fulfil the following tasks, and it is sometimes good to remember them.
First, it must ensure internal and external security.
Second, it must ensure independent dispensation of justice, and third, it must support the sense of community of society by creating a balance between advantage and disadvantage.
Fourth, it must also fill the gaps in public life which are not filled by private business initiative.
But it does not have to operate a state airline, a state post and telephone company and a state railway company.
Where there is competition, it need not hinder it by introducing customs duties on imports and providing subsidies.
The most objective judge of services is and remains the market and not the state.
It determines the value of a service through competition.
So for a state or society, an urgent task is to organize a market, and not services of general interest.
I hope that we will not decide the opposite tomorrow.
