Mr President, the euro, and particularly the coin, is certainly a quintessential component of Europe.
It shows on one side what we have in common, and on the other, individuality, as a symbol of Europe.
I have seen the first designs in Austria, but I was somewhat surprised that "Euro' is printed above the euro, but "Eurocent' is printed above the cent.
This could cause confusion.
Also, the size of the coins is different, and for non-experts it will really be quite difficult to distinguish the eight coins, instead of the six which have been normal up to now.
I will not dwell on the fact that many tills are equipped with six divisions, and must now be converted to eight.
The eight coins will also result in enormous production costs, and given that electronic money will soon be introduced, we are faced with a mass of costs which could have been avoided.
I also wonder how the order will be placed.
Will there be an invitation to tender with government orders?
Will there be a competition?
We have heard that we need 70 billion coins, so the costs will be enormous - how do these costs appear to citizens?
Finally, I also believe that the 100 Euro gold coin can be a symbol of confidence in the new currency, even as a commemorative coin, even in a limited edition.
I believe Europe has an important task here, and we must improve the coins a lot.
Parliament made some proposals about this at first reading, but I believe it will be some time before we get the ideal system.
This need for improvement must be flagged up today, and I hope that it will be carried out in the second round.
