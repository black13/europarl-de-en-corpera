Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, each budget is a visiting card for the political will behind it.
The desire for rigour and prudence behind this budget cannot be denied, even though the need to accommodate the financial prudence demanded by the national governments in order to meet the convergence criteria has been cited as the motivation for it.
Perhaps this rather banal reason is responsible for the fact that cuts are still tending to be made too much across the board and too little with a specific target in mind.
The priorities set by the budget are generally unsatisfactory, it seems to me.
Courageous attempts to tackle effectively the major problems Europe is struggling with are modest at best.
I would like to address the research and technological development sector because it continues to remain extremely under-resourced.
Comparing research and development on the one hand with the cultivation of olives, sugar and tobacco on the other may sound polemical perhaps, but it is symbolic of the priorities which, rather than promote the competitiveness of the European economy, target the interests of particular groups.
The total spending on R&D is rated at ECU 3.49 billion, of which only ECU 487 million are apportioned to information technology.
The total spending on olives, sugar and tobacco, in contrast, amounts to some ECU 4.5 billion altogether.
There is a succession of technological areas where European industry, particularly the small and medium-sized enterprises, increasingly lacks the competitive edge over its American rivals.
The danger is that shares of the global market will be lost and the problem of unemployment made worse.
Since both the Americans and the Japanese invest enormous sums in research, every additional ECU the Community spends in this area in future will have been usefully employed in the fight against unemployment.
