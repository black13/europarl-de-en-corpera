Mr President, a budget without fresh borrowing is something really special in Europe and the world.
Not only is fresh borrowing not required, but a reserve has been built up too.
I think this is something we should constantly remind the listeners in the gallery of when we talk about the European Community's budget, that such careful planning is made that there is a little left over each year.
We hope the national governments will follow the example we have set.
We draw up financial plans too, of course, multiannual ones, currently from 1997 to 2002, which have tremendous advantages for planning, increasing clarity and accuracy alike.
Take the ECSC for instance, where there is now a schedule of assets, from which you can tell at a glance which monies are required in future and which are not.
We have increased the research grants, we have increased the funds for education, and we are trying to support those that are efficient to create new jobs.
We know we cannot create new jobs through spending alone.
The state cannot do it.
We need to create incentives to make employers prepared to do more in this area.
I think that retaining the 11 % levy for the ECSC is not wise.
What we are actively doing is in fact legally suspect, and I think the steel levy in particular would definitely come up against problems in this respect under article 50.
In addition, companies which work well are under enormous pressure from non-EU steel imports, which are made easier by this.
Our companies are losing their competitiveness, while substitutes for steel and coal are becoming more competitive.
That is why I think that retaining the levy would damage our healthy industries.
