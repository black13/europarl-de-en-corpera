Mr President, please forgive me for commenting on the order of business at the start of this debate.
Yet I cannot avoid making two critical observations on the procedure for today's debate, and I address my remarks to you, Mr President, together with a request.
For the third time in succession now we are experiencing how the debate on the success of cooperation in the area of justice and home affairs has been placed on the agenda in such a way that what occurs is what happened this afternoon, namely that we had to interrupt the discussion to make way for our important votes.
That is not good for the debate.
I would ask you to find another place on the agenda for such a central issue, which allows us to discuss this in context.
I have a second request to make, Mr President, together with another critical observation: I am very grateful to the Commissioner, Mrs Gradin, for concluding her speech this afternoon.
I would not have brought my speech to a close in her position, for the way in which this House thinks it can treat a Commissioner is unacceptable!
I say this particularly for our benefit, ladies and gentlemen, and would ask every one of us present here today to ensure in the groups that we do not ruin our reputation.
You cannot treat a Member of the Commission in this way with such an important debate!
I urgently request that we refrain from doing so in future.
If discussion is taking place at lunchtime - on this occasion Mrs Gradin was the victim; normally it is other people, either speakers or representatives from the Council or Commission -this is intolerable.
No-one ever listens.
That is disgraceful for the Parliament of Europe!
I would therefore entreat you, Mr President, to make this a matter for discussion in the Conference of Presidents.
Thank you!
