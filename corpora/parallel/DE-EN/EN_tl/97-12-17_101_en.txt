Mr President, first I would like to thank you very much for being here, and also ask you to pass on our best wishes to your colleague for his recovery as soon as possible, because he has really done outstanding work here.
I only wanted to put one question about your previous answer: One of Meciar's main arguments is always, in all his speeches, that he recognizes only individual rights and not collective rights.
Do you intend to emphasize as much as possible that precisely minority questions depend above all on collective rights, and not individual rights?
That is always the way in which Mr Meciar tries to avoid a definite answer.
