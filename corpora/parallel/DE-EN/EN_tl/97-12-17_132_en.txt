Mr President, the fact is that I have received the proposal for a law concerning a voting right for Gibraltar from the British House of Commons, but only after I put this question - I did not know about it before.
I have heard that it is not the first proposal.
Other proposals have already been rejected.
But here there was the opinion that this proposal of 1July of this year had a better chance.
I do not know how that can be combined with that.
Furthermore, the legal situation - looking at Gibraltar today - is rather divided, if you take on one side the Pe침칩n and on the other the isthmus, because the Pe침칩n practically belongs to England according to the Treaty of Utrecht, whereas in the case of the isthmus there is some dispute about who it belongs to, even if it is now quite clearly under British administration.
