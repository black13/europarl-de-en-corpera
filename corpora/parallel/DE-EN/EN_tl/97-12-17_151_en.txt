Mr President, the problem in Kosovo is simply that because of years of neglect by the international community - by which I do not mean the Luxembourg Council Presidency, which has actually done something - a situation has arisen in which everything threatens to escalate and outbreaks of violence are expected.
Therefore, we must really try, before it is too late, to bring about a political solution, even by pressure.
The Americans have an office in Pristina, and the European Union has been talking about it for years and has no office in Pristina.
The same obviously applies to autonomy.
The autonomy of Kosovo was a constituent part of the constitution of Yugoslavia before it broke up.
We must press for the restoration of this autonomy.
I believe that the attitude which Yugoslavia took at the Petersberg conference in Bonn, that this is an internal affair of Yugoslavia, cannot be accepted simply because we know that there are hundreds of thousands of displaced persons and refugees from Kosovo in the territory of the EU.
My question is therefore: Are further steps planned?
