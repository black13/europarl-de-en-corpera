Madam President, I have just come from my group's Christmas party, and I was wondering whether I should be eating olives or come and talk about them, but out of respect for our rapporteur, Mr Jov√© Peres, and in view of the importance of olives for the history of civilization in the south of Europe at least, I decided to come for these one and a half minutes.
Our group has of course also been concerned about the potential for simplifying matters and the possibilities for preventing fraud.
However, we believe that the rapporteur is right, and that olives should actually be harvested.
If we grant aid related solely to the olive tree itself, then we are not recognizing the value of work.
This would be tantamount to paying for planting without any intention of achieving a crop, and that is why we support the rapporteur.
I am sorry, Mr Fantuzzi, but we want to reward work, and the quality of the product.
There are good reasons for accepting your ideas on account of manageability and fraud prevention.
But because of the fundamental considerations I have mentioned, our group has decided to stick to this approach, which we also adopted in the Agriculture Committee.
