Madam President, before us today we have an amendment to framework Directive 89, which relates to particular nutritional uses.
There was an argument between the Commission and the European Parliament about how many specific directives should be adopted.
This Parliament had already requested that foods for diabetics and sports foods should be covered by specific directives.
I realise that the Commission want to have fewer specific directives, but these products are already on the market, and many citizens are already used to them.
The problem is that if things are now changed in this way, people who are already used to a particular type of food will suddenly be effectively deprived of adequate information.
The Council has complied with the Parliament's request.
It was particularly striking that the Council adopted this unanimously, which is why I am somewhat unhappy that it is now proposed to take sports foods back out, and with the support of the Socialist Group, who did not, incidentally, take that line during the first reading.
My group opposes taking out sports foods, so we shall not be voting for this amendment.
I believe that we should keep everything as it was originally.
Sports foods in particular need to be properly controlled, because consumers' health is at stake, they have to be protected against false and inaccurate claims, not to mention the effect of such foodstuffs.
Nobody is obliged to buy foodstuffs of this kind, but we think that people who want to do so should also have the option of being provided with a high standard of information.
