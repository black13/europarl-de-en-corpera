Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to appeal to you again in the strongest terms to support at second reading as well the amendment requiring baby food to be pesticide-free.
Mrs Sandb√¶k, you are mistaken in saying that is already covered, it is just the opposite!
There is still no agreement within the Commission that this food should be pesticide free.
It has merely been suggested to the committees that the German system, namely a zero detection limit, should be adopted.
But that does not mean pesticide-free.
I feel that particularly in an area as sensitive as baby food, the precautionary principle should apply.
Scandals in the past about baby food contaminated with lindane particularly disturbed consumers.
We have to make it clear that the precautionary principle must apply here.
It is possible to produce pesticide-free baby food, and the child's body is after all especially sensitive to carcinogenic substances in food.
My last point is on sports foods.
I do not think that we should make special foods for every group, otherwise we will end up with MEP food, which might have to cater for the special condition needed for sessions which last late into the night!
We should also speak out against the use of novel food ingredients in baby food.
