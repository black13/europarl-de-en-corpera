Madam President, I would also like to speak about baby food.
Like others in this House, my group is calling for a ban on pesticides in baby food, although I have to say that we believe this criterion will be met if the limit value set is close to the detection limit.
Unfortunately, the Commission has not got that far yet.
We are extremely annoyed that this subject has been repeatedly put off by the Commission, and that they quite simply do not get round to it.
Scientific data is already available, and there are clear grounds for saying that, for lindane for example, the limit value applying to adult foods is just not enough, and babies are clearly more sensitive than adults.
BSE should have taught us that whenever there is even a mere suspicion, we should take it very seriously and rule out any risk.
Now, maybe the Commission is going to say that this is the wrong place, and that this should not be sorted out here.
In that case, I wonder why the Commission has not yet sorted it out in the right place!
You should have decided on a limit value close to the detection limit long ago, and then we would not still be discussing this.
If you discuss this over the next few weeks, I hope it will be settled, and then there will not of course be any need for this amendment.
If you can say today that you will do that, then our amendment can be dropped.
But I appeal to the Commission to set really strict limit values.
