Mr Juncker, you are right.
The most important decision of the summit was to decide on no postponement of the euro.
But that has consequences.
Even intelligence, prudence and tireless commitment must be measured against the requirements which are set by the introduction of the euro.
We need as a counterweight an effective, jointly coordinated policy against mass unemployment.
You might say that in Essen there was a pursing of the lips.
In Luxembourg there was a trial whistle.
A first test run may be useful, but not enough to get a grip on the problem.
The aims have too many loopholes, and you know that.
Second: regarding the setting up of the European central bank and Euro-X, really the softest possible form has been found: informal, vague task description, unclear definition of the opt-outs.
Third: regarding tax harmonization, to a large extent it has remained as intended.
Even the code of conduct has as many explanations of exceptions as a Swiss cheese has holes, so considerable work remains to be done there.
We should not fool ourselves.
Gramsci said that optimism of the will is needed to do anything.
But pessimism of the intellect is also needed.
Very much remains to be done, too much.
At least the starting line and course are sketched out, and the Luxembourg Presidency must surely be thanked for that.
When we in Germany manage to make a political change of course, we in Europe can probably learn to go actually together in a correct - more productive and with more effect on employment - direction.
