Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, under the energetic and imaginative leadership of Luxembourg, good, noteworthy progress has been achieved in the field of internal and legal policy, in many particular fields, from organized crime to delivery of documents in civil and commercial court cases.
What matters now is to combine these individual steps into a total concept.
We must make the European legal area co-extensive with the European economic area.
We have become used to being able to claim the whole internal market for commerce.
The legal instruments which protect commerce are still blocked by national internal borders.
Now we must therefore ensure that, wherever trade throughout the Union is possible, we also provide legal protection throughout the Union.
For this purpose we need a convincing total concept, which does not consist of transferring national legal systems to the Community, but which ensures that there are legal instruments with Community effect where Community trade is possible.
That must be at the centre of the work in the legal and internal fields in future.
If you will allow me a comment on the side, Mr President of the Council: If it is true that secret data from the Schengen computer has been sold to organized crime, as the Neue ZÃ¼rcher Zeitung has reported, that would be an unprecedented scandal and would have to have consequences both in the security system and for the responsible individuals, and I believe that it would be altogether advisable if the President of the Council would look into it, even though the Union has not been responsible for Schengen up to now.
