Mr President, first I would like to thank Prime Minister Juncker very much.
I think that it is exemplary that you are available to Parliament here in person for questions.
I believe - and I would like to emphasize this explicitly to this audience, because we were very glad about it - the Council has followed Parliament's line and not mentioned the word Slovakia explicitly.
Nevertheless we should do everything so that the criteria which are very important for us are fulfilled there.
The first problem is the minority question.
The second is the question of Mr Gaulider, the member of parliament, and I believe that we on the European side cannot emphasize too much that the Gaulider question must be solved.
We know that that is related to President Kov√°c and with the elections in the autumn, and my question is: Do you believe that the European Union has an opportunity to solve this Gaulider case before the elections in Slovakia?
