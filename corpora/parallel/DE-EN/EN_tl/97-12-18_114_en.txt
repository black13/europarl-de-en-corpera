Madam President, the outcome of the Kyoto Conference was disappointing.
The climate agreement is neither one thing nor another.
It will not prevent global warming, at best it will only slow it down, and we must assume that emissions will be reduced at most by 5 %, though we know that a reduction of between 60 % and 80 % is required in the industrialized nations.
We are very disappointed that the EU abandoned its position on a 15 % reduction and in this respect we await a clear statement from you, Madam Commissioner, on whether or not you are now prepared to take the lead here and stick with 15 % in the future.
It is incomprehensible that you allowed yourself to be beaten down on this issue, that you gave in to industry's moaning about competitive advantage, instead of seriously tackling the issue of how to solve our climate problems.
Global warming is too important an issue to be dealt with at such a toddling pace.
We now expect you to take real steps here, since we all know that it is not the summit debate itself which is important, but rather the actions which are taken as part of our everyday affairs.
If you continue to procrastinate on this issue, if you are not prepared to contemplate an environmentally-friendly energy policy, the introduction of an eco-tax and even the reduction of road traffic levels, then you are demonstrating to the whole world that you were only play-acting at Kyoto and that the EU is not really serious about tackling the environmental issue.
In preparation for Buenos Aires we are therefore pleading for the 15 % reduction and for the ultimate introduction of an environmentally-friendly energy and environment policy.
You have done seriously little to bring this about, Madam Commissioner, for where are the instruments needed to achieve this reduction target?
This is what should be on the agenda, the means for real action, and not merely diplomatic rhetoric.
