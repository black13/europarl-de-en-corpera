Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we all drew a sigh of relief when the Ottawa conference showed that a moratorium was being set up to prevent the spread of landmines.
However, this should not signify that we can now take a breather, that we can now relax our efforts, but rather it means that we have even more problems to tackle - such as the illegal trade in anti-personnel mines.
Illegal devices have, for example, already been discovered in mined areas around the town of Vukovar.
The second point I wish to raise is that we must be careful not to lump all non-signatories together, since this group also includes some countries, such as Finland, who operate a very strict monitoring procedure to ensure that no mines are exported from their territory to other parts of the world.
I believe that points 6 and 8 of our resolution are of particular importance.
It would constitute a major step forward if those countries who have not yet signed the moratorium, particularly the nations of Asia, could be drawn into a commitment to stop the export of these devices, so that the trade in landmines, and possibly even the illegal trade in such weapons, would no longer be supplied from these countries.
The question which I wish to put to the Commission is therefore as follows: How do you view the likelihood of forcing those countries, with whom we have a cooperation treaty or suchlike, to introduce such an export ban?
