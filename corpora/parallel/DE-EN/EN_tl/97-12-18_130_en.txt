Mr President, the Ottawa Conference represented a first small step, a first small victory on the long road to a comprehensive ban on landmines.
I think that the Canadian government should be congratulated on this achievement, as indeed should be Nobel Peace Prize winners Jody Williams and Thomas Gebauer of Medico International, who pressed ahead with their landmine campaign in Europe and who provided support for the Ottawa resolution.
It is now a crime to manufacture, store and deploy landmines.
We must intensify our efforts and work towards a comprehensive ban on such devices.
Whether we call them anti-personnel mines, landmines or anti-tank mines, at the end of the day, a mine is a mine, a mine is a weapon and as such it is an inhuman and deadly device.
It does not discriminate between a bus full of children or a tank.
For this reason, all mines should be banned.
In the wake of the Canadian conference the EU Member States must now ratify the Ottawa Treaty, implement its provisions as soon as possible and urge the USA, Russia, China and India to do the same.
In closing let me point out that further measures are needed in this respect and that funds must be provided for rehabilitation.
The Member States themselves should take steps to ensure that no more mines are produced.
To this effect we must make a commitment so that we are not subsequently obliged to spend money on curing the suffering which we ourselves have caused.
Thank you.
