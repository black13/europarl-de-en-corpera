Mr President, it is difficult indeed in the melee of Burundi, which is beset by civil war, attacks on minorities, tribal and clan feuds, to find the all-important red thread which would mark the beginning of a peace process.
It would be easier if we could assume that all those involved were honestly striving to settle their differences without recourse to arms, but that is just not the case.
We have had a quote from an NGO, which has been mentioned by three Member States and by my own in particular.
I would like to say that I would be keen to check out this source, since no other country in Europe has such strict arms export laws as the Federal Republic of Germany.
It is also important to distinguish whether this involves the equipping of police units, whose job is to protect the unarmed civilian population, or what the details of this report actually are.
It is clear that even if our conditions were met, we are still unlikely to see peace in this region, so deplorable is the whole situation.
