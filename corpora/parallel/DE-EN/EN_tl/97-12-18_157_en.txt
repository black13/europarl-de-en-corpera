Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Croatia is without doubt in a difficult situation.
After a war which has seen the repatriation of refugees, still tending towards nationalism, I can well understand why democracy has not been able to develop fully.
But it is a matter for particular regret that unfortunately, as we witnessed during our delegation's visit, justified complaints are increasingly common that serious problems exist in respect of press freedom.
Dealing with the media is never easy in any country, and certainly not in one which is in the grip of a social crisis.
But it is because Croatia has avowed allegiance to the European ideal, and seeks a rapprochement with us - or at least that is what is being declared - that the European Parliament must be strict in its dealings and must apply certain criteria.
After our visit I personally suggested considering whether we should provide more financial aid under the Phare programme on the basis of conditionality, when this suits Croatia and when Croatia takes active steps towards democracy, the integration of its refugees, and so on.
I regret all the more that the positive responses which we as European parliamentarians tried to give are not really being met with positive reactions from the Croatian side.
In this sense we naturally support the resolution and call upon Croatia to do everything in its power to develop a fully democratic State.
