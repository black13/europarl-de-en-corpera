Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my Party supports this resolution because we too wish to assist Croatia in developing the type of society which we in Europe accept as normal.
As far as the electronic medium is concerned, we soon expect to see a proper Croatian television service operating under public law.
The sensitivity of Croatia's rulers to critical articles, both justified and unwarranted, which have appeared in various press media has often led to an over-reaction, and this we condemn.
The new right of association and assembly is now in line with European standards.
Foundations in Croatia can now exist quite happily under the new system.
Only the Soros Foundation has problems with this, since it has now lost its former privileges.
The Open Society Foundation is now also obliged to register as a foundation, and it is unwilling to do so.
It wants to retain its NGO status.
There are more than 1, 800 NGOs operating in Croatia.
What is needed is a regulative law similar to that which operates in the rest of Europe.
These organizations have to demonstrate, for example, that they are there for the public benefit, that is to say that they are non-profit making.
The bill to regulate humanitarian organizations, which is now before the Croatian Parliament, the Sabor, still has its flaws.
We call upon our colleagues in that Parliament to make improvements by introducing amendments to the legislative process.
We are quite confident that this will happen and today's motion will certainly help to support these efforts.
