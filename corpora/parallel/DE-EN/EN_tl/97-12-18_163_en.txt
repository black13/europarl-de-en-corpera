Mr President, it gave me great pleasure to read the resolution before us here today.
For it is the very newspaper for which I work which is being portrayed as the object of persecution.
I know only too well that Globus is in fact one of Croatia's keenest opposition papers, that it criticizes the Croatian Government in a manner which would not be tolerated in certain other countries, even democratic ones.
I know this because I have a lot to do with the editorship of this newspaper.
I do not even consider it unreasonable that action has been taken against Globus, since I am aware of a number of democratic countries close to Croatia in which similar events have also been reported, where editors of certain newspapers have even had to resign because they have offended the head of government.
I would just like to make one point.
As Mr Swoboda has stated so effectively, Croatia faces enormous difficulties.
The country has been destroyed by war and has a huge problem with refugees, which Croatia has had to accommodate in very large numbers.
Yet for all this, there is no doubt that in this respect the situation is not all bad.
I personally was present during the elections in Croatia, where I was following the efforts of the opposition parties, and I can say that these opposition groups were able to operate quite freely and even achieved real successes.
That the outcome of the elections was somewhat different can be blamed on the electors, but not on the government.
I make these comments only to point out that Croatia is a European State, that its culture is primarily European and that we are all keen to help that country in its current difficulties.
This does not mean kicking it in the shins, but rather providing real support for the efforts which are currently being made there.
That should be the real intentions of this House.
