Mr President, my comments concern the urgency resolution under consideration.
I am always for economy measures, but when I tried to get hold of the text of the resolution, as usual, I was given the joint resolutions - but not the original texts.
The reason given was that this was a cost saving measure.
This simply cannot be true, since joint resolutions are often rejected in this House, to the effect that one then has to revert to the original texts.
I would ask for clarification on this matter.
Thanks to the efforts of Mrs Pack, for example, the absurd motion on Croatia is now somewhat less so, yet I would still have welcomed the opportunity to read the absurd texts in their original form.
I earnestly request that something be done to remedy this situation.
