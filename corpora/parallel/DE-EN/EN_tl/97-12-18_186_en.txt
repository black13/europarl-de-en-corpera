Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the possession of human rights allows each individual man and woman to retain his or her dignity.
Human rights are indivisible and universal.
I stress this yet again because it is a fact which is sometimes overlooked in the daily routine of EU politics.
The protection of human rights and minorities and the furtherance of democracy must be priority issues for a combined foreign and defence policy.
We strongly reject any attempt to reverse these priorities in order to promote the cause of economic relations.
Parliament will be keeping the pressure on and, what is more, has even established a budget line for the promotion of democracy and the protection of human rights to the effect that a financial basis has now been laid for real action.
However, the EU is still a long way from having a coherent civil foreign policy.
As long as departmentalized thinking continues, as long as foreign policy is divided geographically within the Commission and as long as development policy is subjected to constant budget cuts, we shall never succeed in evolving a consistent and integrated human rights policy.
Such a sound concept is of course the basis for a credible foreign policy.
The Commission itself is not in a position to carry through the human rights programme because there simply is no comprehensive strategy for all EU policies.
In this respect Mr Lenz's report on proposals for improving our administrative structure is particularly valuable.
We support the proposal for setting up an office of human rights and democracy within the Commission.
This would also facilitate collaboration with non-governmental organizations, which are an important part of a durable policy on human rights and democratization.
I refer in particular to decentralized projects based on local initiatives which make a vital contribution to social stability and to human rights activities which seek to protect and restore the dignity of individual men and women.
