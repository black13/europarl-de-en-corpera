Madam President, I wish to congratulate Mr Imbeni and Mrs Lenz on their reports and to state that naturally we must focus our efforts on increasing the effectiveness of the Commission itself in all its policies, rather than shifting responsibility away from the Commission by way of various offices and other structures.
I believe that this has become quite clear.
I also wish to refer to a particular matter which has been discussed in detail in the Committee on Budgets, namely a change in the structure of interinstitutional cooperation.
I believe that this is very important.
We are dissolving the old advisory group, which used to draw up recommendations for individual projects in conjunction with the Commission and the various institutions, and intend setting up an interinstitutional consultative working group whose role will be to assess the annual Work Programme.
This proposal is set out in our amendment.
This seems to be a more rational way for Parliament and Commission to deal with one another.
And I hope that by discussing a Work Programme at the beginning of the year we will really introduce greater transparency and control into this area.
