Madam President, Mr Commissioner, human rights are valued very highly in Austria.
Looking ahead to Austria's Council presidency in the second half of next year we are conscious of the fact that in 1998 we are celebrating Human Rights Year, and this is an issue which will assume increasing significance.
Next autumn, an experts conference on this theme is to be held in Vienna and on the eve of the summit meeting of Heads of State and of Government in Vienna the Foreign Ministers will commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Declaration of Human Rights.
This will also see the adoption of action plan "Human Rights 2000' .
Such actions serve to illustrate the high priority which Austria attaches to the subject of human rights.
I welcome the proposals being put forward by the rapporteur and by Mr Imbeni, since I too believe that it is sensible to have a uniform structure to deal with human rights and democratisation.
Better coordination within the Commission, a strengthening of the Council's authority over human rights issues and greater cooperation with the European Parliament, all these would be very welcome moves indeed.
The aim of the 1998 Year of Human Rights must be to underpin the respect of universal standards of human rights at national level by effective control, support and deterrence.
Over the last 50 years the international system has laid the legal and practical foundation for the protection of human rights.
Now it is time for these principles to be implemented at national and local level.
All too often, unfortunately, economic interests take precedence over human rights issues.
We in the European Parliament must, therefore, never relax in our determination to draw attention to human rights violations.
But to put something into practice also means ratifying it, and in international law this is regrettably not always possible.
Consequently, in this Year of Human Rights 1998, we must assert our democratically legitimate role as a guardian of these principles.
