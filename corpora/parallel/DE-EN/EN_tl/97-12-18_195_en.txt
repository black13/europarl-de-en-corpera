Madam President, I wish firstly to thank Mrs Lenz and Mr Imbeni most heartily for the excellent work which they have undertaken.
In this respect I would like to make a number of comments which are indirectly connected with their report and which have probably been engendered by it.
The first of these concerns the fact that we have far too many organizations working against each other and generally getting in each other's way.
We have to establish some kind of order here.
I am looking at his mainly from the perspective of those peoples who are in direct contact with the actions concerned, since I frequently travel to central and eastern Europe, where I am witness to the major problems which arise, and this is something which we must bear in mind.
My second point is one which has already been touched on, namely that we must exercise stricter control on the assistance we provide, for this is an important matter.
We already have a very good Committee on Budgetary Control, and its work is exemplary, but this body is hardly in a position to take on additional responsibilities.
However, there is no doubt that some similar type of organization would be required here.
As far as the annual reports are concerned, I consider these to be absolutely essential, particularly when they are entrusted to people who really know something about the subject.
In conclusion let me add one more thing: The respect of human rights is a very laudable principle.
However, all too often this can be used by certain regimes to conceal the fact that they do not adequately recognize collective rights.
I see this especially in the treatment of minority groups - linguistic minorities, racial minorities and ethnic minorities.
I believe we should draw attention to the fact that a European bill of rights for ethnic groups and minorities is absolutely imperative.
This must be made prosecutable in law so that we can ultimately bring real order to this area of human affairs.
