Mr President, Amendment No 122 proposed by Mrs McNally and others on behalf of the Socialist Group provides for the creation and development of supporting measures for businesswomen.
A separate programme dedicated to female entrepreneurs, namely the Now programme, has already been set up under the European social fund, and I do believe it is more logical to combine our efforts in this area.
I only say this by way of explanation.
We support the proposal in principle, but believe that it is somewhat out of place here.
