Mr President, this was an initiative by the Green Group in the European Parliament because, although the novel foods regulation has been in force since 15 May, the Commission has been keeping us waiting, saying that there would also be provisions for genetically modified maize and soya.
But what has happened?
Nothing!
When are you finally going to stop your delaying tactics towards consumers and towards this Parliament?
How much longer do you intend to keep consumers in the dark?
When are the Commission and the Standing Committee on Foodstuffs finally going to agree on clear labelling of maize and soya?
Mrs Cresson, I see that you are with us today.
In other contexts we are always hearing about the latest progress in genetic engineering.
Why has DNA analysis not been accepted, when it is very much state-of-the-art?
Why has the Commission suggested protein analysis, which is very old-fashioned?
Are we to believe the rumours that only a voluntary agreement by industry is planned?
What is happening about baby food?
Are we going to endorse the Scientific Committee for Food's opinion and exclude novel foods from baby food, including maize and soya?
Why does the Commission not let the producers come up with the analysis method?
Why are millions of ecus of taxpayers' money being wasted, with the analysis methods being funded from the public purse?
Why can you not make a proposal at last?
When is the proposal on additives, flavourings and enzymes coming?
When is the veil of secrecy finally going to be lifted?
When can consumers and we here in this House expect a meaningful proposal on the labelling of genetically modified maize and soya products, which is what both we and consumers want?
