Mr President, I indicated at the beginning that I wanted to speak on the Minutes.
I just wanted to say that page 26 of the Minutes indicates that before the vote on topical and urgent motions for resolutions I pointed out to Mr Cot that only the joint motions were available in all languages and not the motions on which they were based.
Mr Cot replied that this was an exception, and that there had been translation problems.
I made further enquiries at the documentation service afterwards, and they specifically told me that a decision had been taken that the text of original motions on which joint motions were based was no longer to be translated and made available.
I must protest against this, although I am all in favour of economy measures, as it is always possible for us to reject a joint motion, as has often happened, which means voting on the original motions.
We must therefore insist that the original motions should be translated and made available in good time.
