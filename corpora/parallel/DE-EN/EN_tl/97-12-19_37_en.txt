Madam Commissioner, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in Austria genetic engineering is meeting widespread resistance.
The scale of this protest is evident from a petition for a referendum which was supported by 1.3 million people.
Consequently, the Austrian government has in the past reacted extremely sensitively to EU regulations which make it easier to use and release genetically modified plants.
The reason for this often justified mistrust is no secret - genetic modification affects a clearly visible part of our citizens' lives, their food.
Consumers want to know what they are eating, otherwise they lose faith in food products.
To prevent this happening, an important step is to create a system for labelling genetically modified foods so that all consumers can immediately see what they are putting on their children's plates.
It must say on the outside what is inside, it is that simple.
That is why I wonder if it is not tantamount to deceiving consumers if labelling is only required once a discernible amount of modified proteins is present, that is, above a specific limit value.
Should labelling be compulsory as soon as there is a difference from natural products, or only once the difference is detectable?
As genetically modified products are in any case supposed to be an exception, I would also like to know when there will be positive labelling for conventional products as well, or whether a comprehensive and panEuropean uniform labelling system is envisaged only for modified products.
