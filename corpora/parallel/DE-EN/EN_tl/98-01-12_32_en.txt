Mr President, let me first express my sincere thanks to Mr Sarlis for his careful and comprehensive treatment of the subject matter and for his excellent conclusions, with which I agree.
I would just like to look at some of these issues in more detail.
It is regrettable that the Commission has excluded the social question, despite the fact that some 500 000 jobs have already been lost throughout the European rail industry.
Commission proposals are urgently required to provide assistance in the following areas.
Firstly, requirements and procedures for the common recognition of contracts and diplomas awarded to railway staff.
Secondly, retraining of personnel for the new jobs being provided by the new railway companies.
Thirdly, the general harmonization of working conditions for railway employees; and fourthly, the necessary formal and fundamental qualifications and the guarantee of a professional training scheme for personnel who are taken on by the new railway companies.
I would further urge the Commission to propose the necessary structural amendments to the operation of the European social fund so that it can deal with the problems arising in respect of unemployment and early retirement in the railway industry, which in many Member States have been the result of restructuring in the rail transport sector.
I would emphasize that rail transport has a vital role to play in allowing socially disadvantaged citizens, who cannot afford private transport of their own, to assert their right to freedom of mobility.
