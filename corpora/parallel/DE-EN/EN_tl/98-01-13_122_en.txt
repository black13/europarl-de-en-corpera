Mr President, as probably the only Member of the European Parliament with dual residence in the US and in Europe, I would like to sound a note of warning about clich√©s and the arrogant assumption that Americans understand nothing about Europe.
That may once have been true, but it is certainly no longer the case today.
The basis for improved cooperation between the EU and the US is our common interest in economic policy and security.
That means fair competition in the world market on a level playing field, and it implies special responsibility for exchange rate stability between the dollar and the planned euro.
Poorly planned introduction of European monetary union would result in the dollar extending its present dominant position still further.
The inferiority complex that Europeans feel towards the US, which has repeatedly come through in the various speeches here, cannot be talked away: we can only overcome it by real economic strength and an unambiguous security policy.
As regards linking economic relations with individual countries to their human rights record, we Europeans should not be criticizing this, we should instead join forces with the US.
