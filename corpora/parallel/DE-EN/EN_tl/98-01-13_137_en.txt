Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are at present witnessing an enormous crisis in the ASEAN states, that is bound to have global consequences.
The question I ask myself is just what rapid action the European Union and America can take in this case.
I believe we need to develop joint mechanisms to stabilize the situation there.
Maybe we can help as quickly as possible with convergence criteria, benchmarking and best practice.
I am afraid that if we do not help speedily, the consequences for us could be dangerous.
The second point that particularly concerns me about relations between Europe and the United States is that Austria put a very valuable art collection, which belongs to a foundation, at America's disposal.
Now, two pictures from this collection have been unilaterally seized, and I can honestly say that I cannot personally imagine how, if a collection is made available to someone, a collection belonging to a foundation, they can thank you by seizing two important pictures.
