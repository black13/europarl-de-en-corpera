Mr President, Commissioner, over the last few months I have discussed legislation on foodstuffs with people from a wide range of areas and Member States, and have been unable to find anyone who could see why chicory extracts should be covered by a vertical directive with a different legal basis as compared with jams or fruit juices or sugars.
So I think we need to look at the legal basis a lot more closely than just simply saying that these are products derived from primary agricultural products.
Processing is indeed involved and there is also a supra-regional aspect to this, which recently emerged in the debate in committee on added vitamins, and which needs to be examined in much more detail within the Commission.
I do not think we can allow vitamins to be added to fruit juices or milk products, or even jams, without consumers being given adequate information, nor should there be different arrangements in the individual Member States, because I am sure this has got nothing to do with regional customs or local specialities.
I would like to make a few more points about honey.
For one thing, we must not forget that honey is a natural food and it should therefore be analysed in the same way throughout the Union.
Furthermore, the directive should refer to the fact that honey does not just consist of various sugars, chiefly glucose and fructose.
It is possible to create imitation honey using these two sugars, but it would not be the same honey that bee-keepers get from bees.
Beekeepers' work should be highly rated in the European Union, not only because they are involved with honey production, but also - and I think that Mrs Lulling will have more to say about this - because bee-keepers make an important contribution to preserving nature, and to growing the fruit that we enjoy so much in fruit juices and jams, which would not be possible without bees.
