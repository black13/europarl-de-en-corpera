Mr President, whenever we discuss food regulations in this House, we end up having to decide what compromises to agree upon.
No doubt that also applies to national parliaments.
I have the impression that we have forgotten something.
I mean, we should remember that for thousands of years humanity managed without chemical additives.
It seems, and the debate here has confirmed this, that we have lost something - respect for food.
I have in mind genetic engineering in particular: it seems that we feel we have to play God.
The second point is that food production, and above all production of high and superior quality food, is all about jobs - not just in agriculture, but also in retailing.
This applies especially to remote regions with little tourism.
That is why it is important that the Member States should have the option of giving individual regions special designations, and thus apply a higher quality standard than the general European standard prescribed by the Directive.
It should go without saying that consumers should be able to see all the additives in a product, as well as its geographical origin, both of which must be clearly and unmistakably labelled.
We owe this not only to consumers, but also to those producers who rely on producing quality products which are naturally somewhat more expensive than mass-produced food.
