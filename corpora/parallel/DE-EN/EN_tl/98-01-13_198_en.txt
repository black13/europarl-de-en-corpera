Commissioner, I would particularly like to thank you for your reply to Mrs Izquierdo Rojo's question.
But I would like to ask two supplementary questions.
Since I have been a Member of this Parliament, there has only been one notable success in the field of music.
That was the European Year of Music, which took place following an initiative by Mr Hahn.
It was a great success.
Have you used that to prepare plans in readiness for 1 May?
My second point is this: I am deeply concerned about the decline in our folk music.
Folk music is undeniably gradually being killed off by the various mass media.
Will you be taking these very important points into account in your programme, and will you be promoting folk instruments by supporting this music?
This is very important for the future!
