Mr President, my comments are limited to Mr Stevens' report.
I consider the initiative underlying this report to be extremely valuable, but it should not be viewed simply in connection with introducing the euro.
Europe is a leader in the field of smart-card technology, and we must exploit that situation.
Increased use of electronic money would be a further step in the information society, and would have a positive impact on our citizens' lives.
The versatility of smart-card technology could also be used to rationalize administration in the public services sector, allowing substantial budget savings to be made in the medium term.
It would have extremely important consequences if this Parliament initiative boosted willingness to cooperate within the Council, and if the various national initiatives in the field of smart-card technology at least became compatible.
Promoting electronic money is an investment in development in tune with the spirit of the times.
So it is even more amazing that this technological revolution in the payment systems our citizens use has so far scarcely featured in the overall strategy for introducing the euro.
Developments in information and communications technology will also soon have an impact on the way we use money.
Progress in electronic payment systems affects the very idea of money, and we shall have to face up to the consequent fiscal, legal, economic and even political challenges.
I accordingly welcome Mr Stevens' report.
However, it would be helpful if at least part of the budget set aside for advertising the euro could be used to prepare our citizens for the imminent technological change in our money system.
