Mr President, the smaller the amount, the higher the costs are.
This summer I was on holiday with my daughter in Italy, and she changed 100 schillings in a money-changing machine.
It gave her 9, 600 lire.
When we got back to Austria, I gave her back the money, rounded up to 10, 000 lire.
Commissioner, just guess how much money she got from the Austrian machine - she got exactly half, just 50 %!
I think this sort of thing costs a lot of money in tourism and in other areas.
When you consider that we have about 50 % more bank employees than in America, and at higher staff costs at that, and that all this is partly necessary to grapple with the whole area of foreign currency exchange and risk, then we will certainly have to keep an eye on our banks in Europe and consider what banking supervision arrangements we shall need in future.
The fact that the banking system has been one of the main reasons for the crisis in the ASEAN states means that we need to be particularly attentive about a healthy banking system in Europe when we switch to the euro.
At the end of the day, the larger the amounts are, the greater the risk, and I believe that one of our chief tasks should be to limit that risk.
If you consider that between 1985 and 1995 the dollar led to the loss of some 1.3 million jobs in Europe, according to a study by the Austrian Institute of Economic Research, then you will appreciate just how important a single currency is for us.
As for the strength of the euro, I have to say that it is perhaps stronger than many exporters would like.
