Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I should like to make the following enquiry: this is indeed only an individual case which is described here.
There are certainly considerably more cases.
There are organisations whose activity is obstructed or which are simply excluded from Belarus, be it the IRI from the United States of America or also the Pan-Europa-Union from Europe, which have been unable to pursue their activities there.
However, we all know to what extent Russia is itself involved in Belarus and what opportunity it has to influence Belarus.
Do you not think it is time that we, who are pumping so much money into Russia from the European Union, should gradually start knocking at Russia's door and tell them that as they have such an influence in Belarus, they should use their influence there so that these questions of human rights can somehow be tackled in order that we can also somehow exert our influence there
