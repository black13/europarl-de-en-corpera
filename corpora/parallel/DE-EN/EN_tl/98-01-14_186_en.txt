Mr President, it goes without saying that the duration of the SFOR Mandate is also closely linked with internal developments in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
I would like to make two points in this respect.
First the question of returning those who have been expelled.
There are problems everywhere, in all three subdivisions, but most of all in the Republic of Srpska, where there has until now not been any actual return and I would like to ask whether it would not at least be possible to reach a binding agreement with Mrs Plavsic, that opportunities are at last created in the Banja Luka area for the return of expelled persons.
The bishop of Banja Luka was here in Strasbourg a few weeks ago and expressed exactly this demand to us.
The second point refers to the question of war criminals, in particular Mr Karadzic, but also other.
Here too, advances must be made for until these two points are resolved, it will not be possible to terminate the SFOR Mandate either.
