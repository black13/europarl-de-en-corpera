Madam President.
I agree with the rapporteur when he says in Item C of the Preamble that industrial relocation is a phenomenon which follows economic logic and is something which should not be ideologized.
However, limits have to be imposed on economic logic for humanitarian, socio-political and labour-market reasons.
A code of conduct for multinational companies would be welcome.
But when it comes to combating child labour or forced labour, in other words modern slavery, then a code of conduct is not enough.
No European firm should gain competitive advantage at the expense of maltreated children.
As well as combating violations of human rights, which is a top priority matter, Europe should be doing everything in its power to make its economic situation more attractive by a massive increase in research expenditure.
Europe cannot solve the problem of unemployment by way of protectionism and progressive isolationism.
The structural funds should in future be used much more for technological research and innovation.
Our objective in Europe must be to achieve competitive production costs in spite of higher labour charges.
