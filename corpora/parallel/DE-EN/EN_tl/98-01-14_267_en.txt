Mr President, the Commission is basically faced with two different problems.
The first of these concerns the fact that we have still not succeeded in developing a definitive VAT system in the EU which really works.
Such a thing would be extremely beneficial for the development of the internal market and for the EU as a whole.
Mr Cox has pointed out some of the disadvantages resulting from this oversight.
Such a situation can lead to paradoxes, for example a third-country supplier is suddenly no longer liable to VAT, while an EU supplier is liable to this particular tax.
That is naturally quite unsatisfactory and paradoxical.
The second problem concerns the technical revolution which has meant that telecommunications services can now be supplied practically irrespective of geographical situation.
It is therefore now basically possible to offer such services on a planet-wide basis.
In such circumstances I think that Mr Cox's proposal is intended to gain time.
This may well be a logical move, but I believe that we should try really hard to find a solution which is based on a definitive VAT policy and on the use of telecommunications services from the point of view of greater local inclusion, since local inclusion is still possible in this area.
This would be somewhat along the same lines as the Commission's draft directive.
