Mr President, Mr Commissioner, the north-south link through the Brenner is one of the most important routes for road haulage.
The impact suffered by Austria as a result is enormous.
Disproportionately so, in comparison to Switzerland.
Some 30 % more lorries travel through the Brenner than through the Swiss passes.
Many haulage contractors choose the longer routes through the Brenner because they are more financially viable.
This way of thinking on the part of the hauliers must be stopped and the cost advantage involved in using the Brenner must be removed.
The diverted traffic must return to its original route.
In a verbal supplementary amendment we, together with our Austrian colleagues in the Social Democratic Party, are therefore asking the Commission to ensure that in matters of alpine transit no EU Member State is placed in a worse position than Switzerland.
This unfair burden must also be stopped to protect the populations involved.
In order to remove the financial advantage which exists on the Brenner route a common charging system should be introduced for Austria, Switzerland and France.
Lowering the charges in the Brenner, which are already lower than those in Switzerland, sends out the wrong signal and will not help to shift heavy goods traffic to the Swiss routes.
If the burden of charges placed on the haulage contractor were the same on all the routes over the main ridge of the Alps there would be a chance that routes other than the one through the Brenner would be chosen.
For this reason, in its negotiations with the Swiss, the Commission should work towards balancing these charges and securing the admittance of 40 tonne lorries.
The Commission must not shy away from its responsibility to the Member States and to the population, especially in regard to such a sensitive region as the main ridge of the Alps.
