Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this amendment represents quite simply a vote of no confidence in the work of my charming colleague Mrs d'Ancona.
This fact should not be concealed.
Obviously you do not have the confidence to open this amendment to discussion or put it to the vote.
You should also know - despite what my charming colleague Mr Schulz would have us believe - that he is not motivated by improved understanding.
Lurking behind this amendment is the long arm of Tony Blair.
What he has told us here today was actually scripted for him in London.
It is the work of Tony Blair.
The British Government has issued a statement which says: But the UK government has made clear that it has no intention of legalizing or decriminalizing any currently controlled drug.
They can feel their majority wobbling and that's why they want to refer the report back.
We say that a European drug policy should ask only one question: Does it make access to drugs for young people and children harder or easier?
Mrs d'Ancona's policy would make access to drugs for young people and children easier.
We can say no to that by voting no today.
And for this reason we reject the petition.
