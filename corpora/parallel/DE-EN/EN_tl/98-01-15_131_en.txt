Mr President, we welcome the initiative taken by the British Presidency of the Council in playing an active role in this matter and in finally putting this critical point on the agenda.
Of course, the European Parliament has to be included.
But it must also make progressive proposals which will lead somewhere.
For this reason I would like the European Parliament to concentrate on current developments and crisis situations and, this being the case, for light and small arms to play the central role.
We cannot simply leave them aside; we have to include them.
Anyone who has even been in an area of conflict knows just how important this is.
Cooperation on arms issues requires special consideration of technologies with dual applications.
It constitutes another aspect of the debate.
I am also delighted that our proposal to add a ninth criterion to exclude the supply of arms to countries which do not joint the UN arms register has been taken on board.
Of course, a codex of this nature has to be put into practice.
And that means that arms deals must be controlled by national governments.
