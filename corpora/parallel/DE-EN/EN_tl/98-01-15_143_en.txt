Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament's view is clear and unambiguous.
The dignity of mankind forbids any form of cloning.
In the vote on the 5th Research Framework Programme we also refused the provision of funds for research which amounts to human cloning.
Respect for our fellow creatures as well as other considerations also make the cloning of animals a extremely questionable endeavour at the very least.
Today, reports on a money-hungry madman who calls himself a scientist are forcing us to hold this debate for clarification.
This clarification is required to ensure that one perverse case of abuse does not discredit the entire field of biotechnology which we associate with hopes and high expectations.
But there is also a question which we must ask ourselves.
Have we done everything we can to ensure that this new area of research and technology does not slip out of our control and direct itself against men or even mankind?
We have certainly tried.
Today we have before us a network of laws and guidelines which regulate and protect but which also offer loopholes and hiding places which could lead to the abuse of biotechnology.
It is my view, therefore, that a framework guideline is needed which marks out the field and makes the many individual rules transparent.
It must cover all aspects of the issue, including uniform provisions in criminal law which impose severe penalties on the flouting of regulations and violation of bans.
This difficult work is our duty as citizens of the European Union.
We must not dodge it.
We must ask the Member States to sign a Council of Europe document today.
On one hand, the so-called Bioethics Convention fails to solve the problem.
On the other, it offers the principle of subsidiarity under which each Member State may decide whether or not to ratify it.
For this reason let us remove Point 2 from the joint resolution.
