Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are scientists who say yes, we will clone humans.
This is a major affront to human dignity.
It is the irresponsible breaking of ethical dams and taboos.
An absence of ethical boundaries would be a terrifying thing for humanity.
Knowledge without conscience is a horrific scenario!
Yet here we are, faced with a kind of mad and undreamt-of omnipotence.
Unfortunately, the nightmare of a "made to measure' human being or the breeding of humans as a supply of spare parts is becoming more and more realistic, and unimagined ethics are being pushed ever forward.
The international community still has no binding regulations and even in the European Union science has no ethical boundaries.
On the contrary, increasingly it is the scientists who are setting the ethical boundaries for society.
Even the cloning of animals provides expertise for the future cloning of humans.
So what we need - and I ask the Commission if it is ready to do this - is a worldwide non-proliferation treaty for cloning techniques.
We need the worldwide outlawing of cloning because what is technically feasible will one day be done.
It also seems to me to be essential that we exert some economic pressure!
I believe that within the framework of the WTO we should boycott international groups and countries who are not prepared to devise binding rules on the banning of cloning.
In this regard, I should be glad to know whether the Commission is prepared to go beyond non-binding declarations and statements, whether it is prepared to go a step further, to sign a binding agreement and make a worldwide ban on cloning.
