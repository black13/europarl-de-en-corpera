Mr President, the Ingushetia/North Ossetia conflict is a forgotten conflict.
To date, the 60, 000 exiles who have been housed in temporary accommodation since 1992 and the children who have been effectively unable to lead normal lives since then have received little attention in European politics.
Although their return has been agreed, this has not yet proved a practical possibility due to the security situation.
Each incursion spreads renewed panic amongst the waiting population and revives the hatred.
So far there has been no reduction of the potential for conflict in the region.
The Russian ruling power has failed to gain acceptance and the UNHCR remains the only body with any sort of mandate to control the Prigorodny conflict.
Action to prevent the escalation of the conflict is urgently required.
Many times in reports I have indicated the need for the EU to commit humanitarian aid on an ongoing rather than a sporadic basis.
That is why I am calling for the ECHO mandate to be extended to Prigorodny and for the EU to assist the OSZE fact finding mission there in bringing international support into the region in order to resolve the conflict.
