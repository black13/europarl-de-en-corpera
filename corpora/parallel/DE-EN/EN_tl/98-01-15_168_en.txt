Mr President, I am very grateful to Mrs Aglietta for incorporating the idea of a special EU representative for Tibet in her resolution and for maintaining it in the joint resolution.
I made the same proposal last year during question time under the Luxemburg Presidency of the Council and saw how strongly Mr Wohlfahrt responded to the idea at the time.
He promised to push the issue in the Council accordingly.
We should hold discussions with the British Presidency without delay to ensure that these words become deeds.
It is my belief that we need a special representative of this kind, just as the United States do.
We often have grounds here to criticise American foreign policy, but in this case American foreign policy has set a very important example.
In the case of Tibet we are dealing with a very serious problem of human rights and a very serious problem of a people's right to self-determination.
The Chinese think in very long time-frames and we should not therefore react with short term displays of concern, but rather with a long term strategy, and for this we need a special representative.
