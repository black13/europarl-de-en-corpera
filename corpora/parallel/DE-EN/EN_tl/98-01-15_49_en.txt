Mr President, I think we should hear the Commissioner and then no one else, otherwise we will have to plan another round.
It is not acceptable that anyone should be given preference.
I suggest that the Commissioner speak, that we finish and take the vote.
No other speakers should be allowed to speak after the Commissioner.
