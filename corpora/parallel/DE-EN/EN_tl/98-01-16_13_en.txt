Mr President, please excuse me for speaking very briefly about what I find in the Minutes.
It has unfortunately been somewhat misrepresented.
It says here that I started a competition for the most stupid pub language.
Obviously, this did not refer to the German Members and not to all PPE Members.
I must say, to save my honour, that it referred to only two Members, who tried to practise mediaeval politics in modern Europe, like robber barons.
Second point: this megatunnel, about which I spoke, is unfortunately not 20 km long but 50 km.
That is just the problem, that this tragic tube is so long and impracticable.
Excuse me for interfering, but it was important to me.
