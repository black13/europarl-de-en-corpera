Madam President, above all I would first like to thank Mr Ebner for introducing this question, and second, I would like to make a comment.
It shows that the Friday sittings have a purpose, because on Fridays we talk about more serious things, instead of practising demagogy, and besides there is much more consensus between the parties than at other times!
I would like to add to what Mr Macartney said.
He mentioned a very important point, that not only bureaucratic criteria should be applied to defining the regions, that it is not just made to depend on height or depth, but that the climate and social conditions also play a part.
Secondly, I would like to emphasize here that - as we have heard from all sides - it is not just the economy which is crucial.
There is only a social function of the economy, which is the only one which actually means the future.
Particularly for us in the mountain areas - there are very many mountain areas in my home country, although people generally do not know that, but Upper Bavaria consists partly of mountain areas - this means first that the small farmers must be maintained at any price, because without these people there are no more mountains.
Then everything is ruined, as can be seen in all too many places in America, for instance.
Second, in the whole definition of transport we must put always the ecological aspects in the foreground, because when we see the destructive effect which certain roads have already had, through Trentino-Alto Adige for instance, when we know how dangerous certain projects are for us, we have to say that the ecological standpoint must be allowed a quite high status, because only in this way can we maintain the heart of Europe!
