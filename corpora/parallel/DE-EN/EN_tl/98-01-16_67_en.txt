Madam President, Austria is famous for the beautiful Alps and also for the newly created national parks.
Yet an enormous structural change is taking place in these areas.
On the one hand, we endeavour to look after the traditions, the beauty of the land, its naturalness and unspoiledness, and on the other hand we think intensely about the future, safeguarding the future, and the opportunities which the future will bring.
I believe that we must do more research in this area.
We must see with what products and services we can look into the future, we must do market research to see what visitors can come into this region, what aspects of the region are treasured, what services can be offered in this region and what products can be sent out of this region.
The second, and perhaps even more important point is education and further education in these areas.
We should think about what education and further education structure we can offer in these areas.
