Mr President, as the rapporteur has already stated, we in the Christian Democrat and Social Democrat Groups have agreed a common position in the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights.
We support this position.
The rapporteur has done an excellent job.
The fact that we have not restricted the proposal to payment systems alone, but have managed to include securities and settlement systems, is a real achievement.
This was a very important point.
What I also consider to be of great significance is the principle that all creditors be treated equally in the event of insolvency.
Here we have now created a substantial legal framework against a background of maximum publicity and we have done this within the scope of that which can be politically achieved at the present time.
This is all down to Mr Lehne and for this I wish to express to him my heartfelt thanks.
We shall be supporting this common position here in Parliament.
