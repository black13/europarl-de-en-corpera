Mr President, the enlargement of the European Union is important for the whole of Europe and for all Europeans.
What is more important is that this process be undertaken in an orderly fashion.
The membership negotiations which are to commence shortly will seek to achieve this objective.
But the so-called pre-membership strategy also serves to achieve these ends.
Within this strategy one fact which has particular weight is that we quite consciously wish to include the central and eastern European states in one of the most successful Community programmes which we have launched in recent years.
Erasmus is a programme which, in place of neurosis and xenophobia, seeks to establish a Europe-wide network of young people as part of their education process.
These young people have intercultural experience, a knowledge of foreign languages, which is expanding, and are undergoing an expansion and transfer of know-how, from which we shall all profit.
I know this personally as a trustee of one of the Erasmus programmes which brings together law students in 15 Member States, and one hopes that in future this will also include the countries of central and eastern Europe - and the legal fraternity is notoriously difficult to bring together because of the alleged and actual disparity which exists between our various legal systems.
This year for the first time we resolved to extend the Erasmus programme beyond the existing framework.
The Council and the Commission then got out their red pencils.
Criticism has already quite rightly been expressed that, had this House not insisted on its rights of conciliation, then a good idea, and a necessary one for a larger unified Europe, would have seen its progress checked in a way which would have not really been enforceable.
As a university lecturer, I wish to thank all those involved for supporting this initiative.
Good things obviously take time, but this should not be taken to extremes.
