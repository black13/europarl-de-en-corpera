Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we shall probably only really appreciate how important water is when we no longer have any.
That is why it is no coincidence that our Spanish friend has picked this subject.
I should like to give him my very firm support.
Our friends from the northern countries have got somewhat excited about this here today, because they are afraid that the southern countries want to take away their water.
In fact, just the opposite applies, as every tomato or orange from a southern country that we eat in the north actually means that we are taking water away from the south.
Every tourist who travels to Spain or another southern country uses water.
Assuming that everyone uses two to three litres of water a day, that means that tourists visiting Spain alone consume an additional 1 to 3 million cubic metres of water.
So there is already a kind of trade in water, but it is hidden.
Just think of all the bottles of mineral water, Perrier, Apolinaris, San Pellegrino or what you will, that are shipped all over the world.
That is all trade in water, except that it is transported by bottle rather than by pipeline.
At the time of the Roman Empire, they had a 70 kilometre long water pipeline in Cologne, and they also had similar things in other cities.
Why should we not consider transfrontier water pipelines now?
It seems quite normal to me.
Mr Pinel's comment earlier was correct.
We need not only to work on water pipelines but also on proper management of available water.
This seems so obvious to me that it is hardly worth repeating, we just need to get on with it.
Water has a role to play in a Europe without borders, not only oil, gas and electricity, the trans-European networks that we already have.
Why should water not play a similar role?
In any case, I believe that water can be classified as a product or a service under the EU Treaty, it certainly comes under the EU Treaty and is not excluded from normal goods.
