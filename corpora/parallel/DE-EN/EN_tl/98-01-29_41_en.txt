Mr President, I can of course understand the problems of countries who have managed their water differently, and where it is now a commodity in short supply.
But whenever we come across logistical and structural problems it seems we try to solve them by interfering with nature on a gigantic scale.
That has to be wrong, it cannot work in the long run.
Before we consider major pipeline systems, we should consider how water supplies can be provided on the spot.
We should call for urgent studies into the effect of microclimates and the effect of vegetation adjacent to water reserves.
I am very much of the opinion that not only can we influence rainfall, but that we are already influencing it through our actions.
I think that there is enormous scope for doing very positive things with our water resources, including in countries where there are problems at present.
I believe that this debate should make us think about specific measures to solve these problems.
These measures should not consist of setting up yet another network and expecting spurious solutions to solve real problems.
We cannot therefore support this report now.
However, we would like to be constructive and stress that we regard this debate as an opportunity for considering decentralized water management structures, and for investing money in them, because every ECU invested in that way will have an enormous medium and long-term benefit, I am quite convinced of that.
