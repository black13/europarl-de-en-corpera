Mr President, I fully accept the need for bilateral agreements in this area, and I wish Spain and France well.
I am also very grateful to the Members in my delegation, and above all to Mrs GrosstÃªte, for agreeing to an amendment to which I attach great importance, as it makes it perfectly clear that any interference with a Member State's water without its express permission is completely ruled out.
We can only give our support if this amendment is accepted.
I understand that all Member States already have very strict and precise internal regulations governing who may access water and how, so surely this is even more important when it comes to bilateral relations.
I would like to say a few words about those states that have their eye on their neighbours' water: do they really manage their own water carefully?
How do industry, factories and households behave?
Untreated water is discharged into our rivers and lakes in an appalling, dirty and dangerous state.
That is unacceptable.
It is everyone's duty to keep their own ground water reserves clean in the first place, and only then do they have a moral right to even consider looking at their neighbours' water!
I believe that we can only think about trans-European water networks when every country manages its own water with the utmost care.
One thing has to be clear: with the greatest respect, Mrs McNally, we do not want any wars because of water.
So we need to consider rights of ownership very carefully here.
