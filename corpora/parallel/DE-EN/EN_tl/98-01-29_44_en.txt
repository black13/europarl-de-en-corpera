Mr President, before long all the Austrians in the House will have said something on this subject, but we still have not said everything there is to be said.
I would like to tell Mr BÃ¶sch that I am using exactly the same words to say in Austria what I have to say here, and this is not scaremongering.
I am just expressing concern, despite having great sympathy for the problems of other Member States of the European Union.
This report is based on the dangerous assumption that natural resources unevenly spread between the sovereign states of the European Union can be supra-nationally redistributed.
Water is not a natural resource belonging to the European Union, as suggested in recital D, but rather a natural resource at the sole disposal of the people of those countries on whose territory it is found.
We very firmly reject the notion that quantitative aspects of water policy can be treated as a priority European Union policy.
Nevertheless, the report does address some ideas which could provide an appropriate approach to solving the problems of countries where water is in short supply, such as technical measures aimed at improving the poor condition of water pipelines, reforestation or desalination of sea water.
Above all it is necessary to optimize existing local facilities, which would lead to a greater improvement in regions suffering from water shortages.
But intervention by the Commission in quantitative aspects of water policy would run counter to the principle of subsidiarity, and create additional unnecessary supranational powers, which would inevitably result in tensions between Member States.
Quantitative water policy is and must remain the sole preserve of sovereign states.
