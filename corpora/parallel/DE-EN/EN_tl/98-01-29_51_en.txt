Mr President, I too would like to congratulate Mr Pettinari on his report and, like Mr Habsburg-Lothringen, I regret that we are only debating this now after the ink has dried.
Yemen is an interesting country in that it is one of the world's divided countries and a country which is now trying to overcome the problems of division.
Indeed, the reunification process has not been without its setbacks and difficulties in the Yemen.
The agreement we are discussing today is the culmination of valuable cooperation between the EU and Yemen, dating back as far as 1979, as support given to Yemen for economic and development projects totalling ECU 58 million has gradually put the country into an economic and strategic position which suggests that further positive developments are guaranteed.
I believe that another aspect of this positive situation, which Mrs Malone has already described, is the prevailing pluralistic democracy, which seems to be on the right path, despite the criticisms she mentioned, not to mention the cautious economic policy aimed at avoiding social dislocation.
But I am sure that the whole thing will only become stable once the commitments of nearly ECU 2 billion made by last year's conference of donor countries become a reality, and soon.
This agreement will round off, so to speak, the various agreements in the Mediterranean area.
I also believe that Yemen will take this opportunity to prove to us that religious traditions and respect for human rights can certainly be combined.
