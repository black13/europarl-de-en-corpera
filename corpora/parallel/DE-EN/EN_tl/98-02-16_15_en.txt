Mr President, if the so-called tourism affair has become a touchstone for the Commission, then the European institutions, with the European Parliament at their head, must do everything possible to ensure that this scandal does not cause the collapse of the EU's tourism policy.
The rapporteur's proposals, which will help clarify and improve the situation, should therefore be implemented as quickly as possible.
We strongly recommend that a Parliamentary committee of inquiry be set up without delay.
One aim here should be to bring about a general improvement in the Commission's administrative machinery, and not only in the tourism sector.
But in addition, we need to rid tourism of its negative image and poor reputation.
The tourism sector has always been treated like a Cinderella industry by the European Union and has never had its own legal basis in the Treaty.
An intelligent European tourism policy could well provide new job opportunities like practically no other sector of the economy.
It should also be borne in mind that while Europe still leads the world in tourism, it has for years been losing its overall market share.
What is required here is therefore a radical purge which will place the Commission - both in terms of its staff and its budgetary affairs - in a position from which it can really do something for the tourism sector.
