Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, financial aid sounds all very well.
But unfortunately we are being asked here to vote for a process which will keep in motion the international money merry-go-round.
This money is not intended for public programmes.
I quite agree with you that Ukraine is in urgent need of major aid programmes to help it achieve stability and democracy.
Yet with this financial assistance we are using public money from EU taxpayers to pay off the debts which the IMF and the World Bank have established in Ukraine.
These so-called stability programmes completely fail to take account of the realities of the social and economic problems posed by this transformation process, but rather promise to plunge Ukraine into insolvency.
The EU's so-called macro-financial aid is therefore simply a transfer payment via the Ukrainian budget to the IMF and World Bank.
The proposal of the Committee on Budgets is worthy of support and we can accept it.
But in view of the actual international finance deal being done here, even this proposal will not be workable.
