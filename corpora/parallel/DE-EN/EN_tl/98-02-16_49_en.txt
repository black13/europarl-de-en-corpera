Madam Commissioner, allow me to ask another question.
Mr Chichester and I raised the subject of the task forces, which have not been reviewed in the report - or at least have only been given a two-line mention.
In its statement the Commission also failed to say anything about the work of the task forces.
In its response to a previous statement on the research report, the Commission said: "the annual report serves to present to Parliament those aspects which are considered to be of prime importance' .
Am I then right in assuming that the task forces are not regarded as one of the more important aspects here?
