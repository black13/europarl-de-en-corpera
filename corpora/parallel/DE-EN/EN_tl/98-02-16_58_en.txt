Mr President, Madam Commissioner, this argument really needs to be rammed home.
Mr Hughes had to do it too.
There has been much talk of cost saving in the area of health and safety at work, but no mention has been made of the costs which could be saved by those affected, and by our national economies, if we really introduced a proper safety scheme.
As a result, we are again faced with a long-running scandal.
Health and safety in the European workplace is not keeping pace with developments in the internal market and with technological progress.
Mr Hughes has already referred to two directives which are still pending.
In the case of this directive we need to discuss the advantages and drawbacks of the strategy which the Commission has chosen to confront the problem: elegantly-defined principles, progress without protection.
The individual directives can be added later, while we focus on developing the main directive.
But the price will be high.
The problem lies in the content of the framework directive.
We have to ensure that the individual directives do not fall behind the framework directive, and then there is also the problem of harmonizing procedures between the individual framework directives, such as that on explosive atmospheres - which is looming -, for this is creating increasing complications in individual cases and is hampering progress.
I would just like to stress again that Mr Blak has done an excellent job.
I do not believe that Amendment No 16 is better than Amendment No 3, and in the case of Amendment No 18, I would ask Mr Blak why the risk assessment has to be made at the beginning of the information form.
Does this not run contrary to what he has said in Amendment No 6?
