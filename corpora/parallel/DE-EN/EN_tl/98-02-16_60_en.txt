Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, speaking on behalf of our group, Mr Mendon√ßa has already presented the technical aspects of this subject in some detail.
I should therefore like to discuss some of the more general issues involved here.
The Council allowed itself three and a half years before submitting a common position to Parliament after first reading.
This shows just where the delay is in drawing up European legislation.
The rapporteur has taken pains to ensure that the outcome in Parliament does not deviate too much from the common position, so that the directive on the protection of workers' health and safety from the effects of chemical agents at the workplace is neither further delayed nor threatened.
No blame whatsoever can be attached to Mr Blak for this situation.
He has done an excellent job.
At all events, I expect him to give way to the amendment which I am re-submitting to Parliament.
Let me present some of the important facts surrounding this subject.
Technical directives of this type are very significant for workers and for workers' health, but plenty of even more important directives are still needed, for example, on teleworking and the wider aspects of part-time employment.
When does the Commission think it will get around to doing something about this, or does it hope to divert us from the really important issues by submitting technical questions?
Does the Council intend to brood much longer over the directives mentioned by Mr Hughes?
The real victims of all this delay are the working people of Europe and we, as serving politicians in this European Parliament, cannot tolerate this situation any longer.
We expect that progress will ultimately be made in this direction and that the Commission and the Council will take the appropriate steps to see that this is done.
