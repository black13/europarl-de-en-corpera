Mr President, in ecological terms Mrs Hautala and Mr Lange's reports certainly constitute a shining hour in Parliament's history.
What might at first sight appear to be a handicap for the automotive industry is in practice a great opportunity.
It was the same with the catalytic converter: people originally said it would be the downfall of the car industry, but in fact it resulted in technical progress.
By sticking to its old position, the Commission is spoiling the prospects for constructive dialogue, which would be a vital opportunity.
So the car will remain the number one environmental enemy.
The debate about the true costs of road traffic will have to be stepped up.
Parliament has offered a solution, but unfortunately it has not been accepted.
If there is a confrontation, there will be no winners, neither the environment nor the car or oil industries.
There will just be losers, which is a great pity.
While Parliament will certainly pass the elk test tomorrow, in my view the Commission has already failed it.
