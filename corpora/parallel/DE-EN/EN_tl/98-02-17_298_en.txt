Mr President, Madam Commissioner, the car is part of our freedom.
We do not want to give it up, and the car is essential for our economy.
But it is a very young means of transport, still at the beginning of its life cycle.
For me, it is fascinating what the car industry is already capable of.
The competition to get a better and more environmentally friendly car on the market first, the car of the future, is enormous.
However, it is certainly not our job as Members of Parliament to protect the automotive industry in its efforts to produce cars despite the impact on the market and the health of our population.
I also find it fascinating that Renault's exhaust gas expert, Mr Hublain, is calling on this Parliament to adopt stricter requirements for petrol and diesel.
Better fuels are the key to reducing emissions, and we must give them our wholehearted support.
The oil companies are worried about their high investments.
For one thing, the fuels Parliament wants to see already exist in various countries.
No-one denies they will involve greater investment, but the oil companies' balance sheets are remarkably healthy; they are making enormous profits.
I am sure they can take these investments in their stride.
To avoid any misunderstandings, I have nothing against large international companies or anyone else making big profits, but it is our job to look after our population's health, and it is also one of the Community's declared objectives.
As Members of Parliament, we are bound to implement the duties of the Community as laid down in the treaties.
We will have a chance to put this into practice in tomorrow's vote.
