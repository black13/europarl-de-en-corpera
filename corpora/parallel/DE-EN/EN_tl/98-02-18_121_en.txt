Madam President, although I am of the opinion that the irradiation of food is to be avoided in principle, I have made up my mind to vote for the Bloch von Bottnitz' report, so that in the Single Market there can be better information, better monitoring and thus better protection of the health of consumers.
I am extremely sorry that not all colleagues have followed this path and that the required majority has not been achieved.
I am afraid that we have thereby done a great disservice to the consumers of Europe.
