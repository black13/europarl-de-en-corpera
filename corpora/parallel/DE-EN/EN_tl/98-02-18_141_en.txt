My questions relate to Burma.
We have presented and discussed various resolutions on Burma and we were usually in agreement with the Commission and the Council that we must do everything to push forward the democratization process.
This, however, has just not happened.
My question is therefore how the British Presidency intends to present a common foreign policy position on Burma and perhaps to get this process in motion.
The question relates in particular to how the Presidency intends to deal with adherence to the ILO Convention on slave labour.
We know that slave labour prevails in Burma.
How can we ensure this directive is successfully implemented?
I also have a specific question concerning the oil company Premier Oil, which in September 1997 announced its intention to buy the shares of the US firm Texaco from a natural gas company.
Will the British Presidency support that or do you advise them, on the basis of resolutions passed here to desist from doing so?
The third point is that, as we have said, whilst the circumstances in Burma remain as they are, we will be against Burma being included here, on the basis of the treaty arrangements between the European Union and the ASEAN countries.
This is because, as we of course repeatedly emphasize, human rights must be respected and this is also a condition or a part of the treaties.
What will be the attitude of the British Presidency in the continuation of relations between the EU and ASEAN?
