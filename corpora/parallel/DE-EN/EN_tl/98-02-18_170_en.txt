Mr President, I must repeat a part of my question because the Council has not answered it.
I had asked whether the British oil company, Premier Oil, announced in September 1997 its intention to buy shares in a natural gas firm in Yetagun from the US firm Texaco after the latter decided to pull out of Burma.
Now of course we have again universally confirmed our condemnation of the regime.
What is the attitude of the British Presidency of the Council - this was my question before - to this possible purchase?
We really would like an answer on this issue.
Equally - this is a supplementary question to the Commission -, on the issue of the compulsory return of refugees from Thailand to Burma, is humanitarian aid continuing there, guaranteed by the EU?
