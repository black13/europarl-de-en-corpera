Mr President, I am rather disappointed by the Council's answer, because we submitted our questions in writing in good time.
These questions were very much more concrete than your answer, which you have just repeated for the third time.
It is in fact a matter of whether, for example, it is possible that in future the Turkish government will as ever get weapons to fight the Kurdish population and to bombard the Kurdish population.
Is that, as ever, possible?
This specific question was asked and we would like a specific answer.
We have also asked you, what is more, in writing, whether you provide a check on the route and also a check on the end user, and how this looks in real terms.
I would like to ask you to answer these questions, which were before you in good time, in terms as specific as those in which they were asked.
I have one final question.
You said there are positive reactions.
From whom did these positive reactions come?
From the arms industry, perhaps?
