Mr President, I believe it is the first time in this House that a properly introduced motion was refused even during its introduction - in fact we originally wanted to introduce it as an additional point under human rights, and only one opportunity was granted to us to find an alternative in the case of these nuclear tests.
I think in the case of this point it is a question of Members and colleagues being frightened.
In my office in recent weeks, three colleagues have been attacked.
I have spoken with a large number of Members who have also been attacked and I believe we must discuss this subject.
It is not sufficient for us to draw a veil of silence over the matter but we must tackle this problem honestly and frankly.
For this we need to have a discussion in this House and I believe that the President's decision not to permit this discussion here is no guarantee of the safety of our colleagues.
