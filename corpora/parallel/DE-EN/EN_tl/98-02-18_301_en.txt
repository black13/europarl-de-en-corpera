Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like briefly to express an opinion on Mr Le Rachinel's report on the transport of dangerous goods by road.
One of the Union's aims is the completion of the single market.
We should do everything we can to guarantee its successful operation by implementing suitable measures.
In this sense the free passage of vehicles transporting dangerous goods should be possible.
Above all, I believe it is very appropriate to harmonize design features and technical specifications, for example on brake fittings, speed limitations or electrical equipment, to guarantee free passage within the Community.
The creation of a European type-approval system will help ensure that in future no Member State will be able, on grounds which relate to design features, to prohibit a vehicle manufacturer from offering it for sale, or to refuse its approval or use.
The Member States should thus be obliged to produce the necessary legal and administrative regulations within 12 months of the publication of this directive.
