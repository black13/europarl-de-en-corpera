Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at this late hour we are once again discussing transport policy questions.
Let me make just two short remarks.
Firstly, I would like to look at the issue of transportable pressure equipment which unfortunately has figured too briefly in this joint debate.
This is a very important matter, not only from a technical viewpoint - although to me as an engineer it appears thoroughly interesting, - but it also as regards the question of safety of everything which travels on our roads.
It concerns the question of regular monitoring and the capability to carry out this monitoring and I think that here it is the rapporteur, whom I would like to thank sincerely, who has succeeded in presenting a balanced report.
I can only ask the Commission to listen carefully to Parliament.
Secondly, I would like to consider the distinguishing sign of the Member State of registration, that is, the national registration plate.
I consider that, too, to be an important proposal and Mr Koch referred to the problems which we still face.
Here at last we have a regulation with which we can bring Europe to life.
As well as the standard driving licence, which has already been decided on, it is a further symbol to make Europe come to life.
It is a citizen-friendly decision which makes administration simpler.
I would just like to ask you, Commissioner, to take this up perhaps in negotiations with Switzerland too, because it is not sensible or logical to introduce it throughout Europe, and have it recognized in the European Economic Area, and in the associated states, while right in the middle of Europe we have an Island of the Blissful, where we still have to have our stickers.
I ask that you take this up in the negotiations.
