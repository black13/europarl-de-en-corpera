Mr President, Mr Commissioner, I did not intend to spoil your future as announcer of the lottery numbers on the BBC, but you also, of course, have a past as a parliamentarian, and I had asked a question which certainly did not come up in your speech, that is, the question of how this nationality plate will be treated in Switzerland.
I think it is in fact an important point if we introduce it in the European Economic Area but not in Switzerland.
Is the Commission considering the possibility of finding a standard regulation in Europe which includes the Swiss authorities?
