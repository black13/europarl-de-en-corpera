Mr President, after the intervention of Mr Megahy and the events of yesterday I would like to ask you to take the opportunity to discuss in the Bureau how such occurrences can be prevented in future in the interests of the entire Parliament by using the agenda.
That would mean that the whole Parliament has to decide on a rule which prevents such occurrences.
I request sincerely that this should be moved forward very quickly.
