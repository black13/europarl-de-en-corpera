Madam President, I wish to speak about the events of this morning, during which our emergency resolution on crime in Brussels was rejected.
The fear of Members, employees and the public should be taken seriously.
About 50 Members have signed for this motion to be dealt with in Parliament.
It was rejected.
I therefore ask the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities to concern itself with this matter in order to evaluate how this situation is to be assessed.
