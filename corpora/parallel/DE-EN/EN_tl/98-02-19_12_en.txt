Madam President, I apologize for returning from the heights of Ernst J端nger to the quite ordinary parliamentary level of yesterday's Minutes.
On page 8 under the heading "subcritical nuclear tests' is a note saying that there is an objection by Mr R端big.
As a result, the heading "safety in the Leopold District of Brussels' is to be dealt with instead.
I want to make a correction here.
It is not "safety in the Leopold District of Brussels' but "crime in Brussels' .
There is, I believe, a major difference between the two, since we are not fighting here for our own benefit, but in principle for safety in Brussels.
Furthermore, it states here that the President informs us that he has declared the objection to be inadmissible in accordance with Article 47, paragraph 2 and that he intended to send Mr R端big a letter with an explanation.
Mr R端big has received this letter.
I have seen a copy of it.
In the letter there is no more explanation than here in the Minutes.
It would, I believe, be very appropriate, if he could pass on the information he has on to the Bureau.
We would be very grateful if the President could tell us with which offices in Brussels he has had contact, what the concrete results of these conversations were and if he will also inform the House about them.
In any case almost 50 Members have signed the resolution.
They are really concerned about what is happening in Brussels and would therefore like to know what is going on.
I believe the House has a right to be told.
Would it not at least be possible for us to learn this week when we can expect to get this information?
(Applause)
