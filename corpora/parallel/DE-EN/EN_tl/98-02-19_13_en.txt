Mr Habsburg-Lothringen, as far as I know, the President has said that he will take up these contacts.
He has not done so yet and probably the details about whom he will contact are not yet fixed.
I am quite sure that he will report on the matter.
I will, nevertheless, pass this on to the Bureau.
As regards your first comment, the Minutes can contain only what was said.
If the wrong description or wrong terminology is used then that is unfortunate.
However, thanks to your comment the item has now been corrected indirectly.
