Madam President, "life under rubble' was the name of a television documentary after the earthquake in Afghanistan.
Life under the veil - as we have already heard - is the fate of Afghanistan's women.
Not only is this veil extremely unusual even for Islams, but it is a walking prison; those who wear it can see the outside world only through a double grill.
They may not go out alone, they may not go to school, they have practically no access to health care.
This is all because - and I do not like to say this - fanatical men have enslaved their own people, the mothers of their own children, a people who knew about education, whose women practised academic professions.
They are destroying their own dignity along with the well-being and the education of their own children as free people.
What on earth is going to become of these children?
If on 8 March the International Women's Day really has any meaning, then it is for these women who cannot fight against their repression.
Flowers for Kabul must mean many voices for the women of Afghanistan.
We can of course argue about the differences in cultures, but not about a culture which for reasons of gender puts half a nation in prison, simply because the fanatics - the men - see themselves as bearers of their culture, but at the same time earn their money through drugs and weapons.
What kind of concept of honour is that?
Not only all the women of this world but also all the men should rise up against it in the name of the dignity of every human being.
We appeal to the Commission to see to it that the humanitarian aid for Afghanistan goes directly to the women.
For human rights, which are also women's rights, as we know, will remain hollow and meaningless if this does not happen and will lose their impact.
And, ladies and gentlemen, this is all taking place in the year of the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
