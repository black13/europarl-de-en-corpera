Mr President, I am sorry to bring a little spot of bitterness into the current enthusiasm over the question of our relations with Chile, for a quite simple reason.
We should just ask ourselves the question: What is the point of all this?
Look, Pinochet today is no longer a very young man.
I admit he is younger than I am, but nevertheless he will try to catch up with me and so he will not be a danger for very much longer.
In addition I would like to underline one fact and that is that experience always shows, amongst proud people, and the Chileans are a proud people, that interference from outside is something which always rebounds because it leads to a kind of closing of ranks against the interferer.
Therefore I would like to ask that careful consideration is given to whether this resolution really has any point.
It is understandable, but I can only say one thing: I have experienced much in my life and I have always been able to learn two lessons from it.
The first is that when one is victorious one should not take revenge for that has always had a negative effect.
Secondly we should not interfere in things in which we more or less make the others into enemies.
I can give you a concrete example: I was from the beginning in this Parliament in the Animal Protection Group and am, God knows, no supporter of bullfighting, but I have always been against interference.
It should be the Spaniards themselves who put an end to bullfighting.
We should not talk them into it.
This should also apply in my opinion in this case.
