Mr President, the resolution before us is long overdue.
It was discussed for a long time and is a compromise..
Many suggestions and alterations from various groups in the House were incorporated into it before it was submitted.
Therefore I do not claim that it is a green resolution but I believe that it is a resolution of this House.
The news about arbitrary arrests and deprivation of freedom, about repression of the free press - for example the film maker Saschewatzki was attacked in his apartment because he showed a critical film on German television - requires a response from the European Parliament.
We have been exposed for a long time now to the questions; why is the European Parliament silent when faced with the fact that there is practically a war against the media in Belarus?
Is it perhaps that we do not care about the fate of people?
Is there maybe a creeping acceptance of Lukaschenko's policies?
I hope that with this resolution we give a clear answer.
Lukaschenko has long recognizedd the isolation into which he has driven his country and its people, and he is very interested in international recognition.
But he is not prepared to make concessions in the direction of democratisation.
Therefore any demand for international human rights is a precondition of recognition.
I hope that we do not betray the trust of the Belarus people and that the resolution receives the broad agreement of this House.
