Mr President, I too would like at this point to thank Mrs Schroedter for her efforts on behalf of White Russia.
I believe that, simply because it is one of the last major dictatorships on European soil, it is necessary to give appropriate signals and to say that we in the European Parliament do not want such a regime in our immediate neighbourhood.
I would however also like to thank Mrs Mann and say: Something has undoubtedly been done in White Russia, something has changed for the better.
Organisations today can become active, albeit on a restricted basis, which was not all that long ago really not the case, and we should admit that here in this Parliament.
Of course it is clear that these steps do not go far enough.
I believe we must also cast a glance at the conditions under which Belarus exists at the moment.
The fact is that the relationship of dependency on Russia is a very close one, that the cooperation between Belarus and Russia is very, very close.
I once permitted myself at question time - if I remember rightly it was two months ago - to ask the responsible Council Representative the question, whether there might be a possibility during the next negotiations with the Russian government to insist that Russia makes its influence on Mr Lukaschenko tell, to improve these circumstances.
This was accepted at the time very positively.
I would also be very grateful if Commissioner Marin would take this idea further and say: we cannot apply the lever in White Russia.
We must undoubtedly apply it in Russia in order to achieve a better result there.
Nevertheless the resolution is necessary and it is important that we state our case.
But we must also be quite clear that as soon as something really changes for the better we must also honour it appropriately.
