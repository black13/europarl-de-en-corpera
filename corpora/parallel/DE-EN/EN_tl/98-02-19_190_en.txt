Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, classical case for the EU to prove that it is serious about a common foreign and security policy, for the comprehensive banning of these tests has been signed by all EU Member States.
Thus the Member States assume the responsibility for ensuring genuine adherence to this treaty.
The danger that it will be surreptitiously undermined - Mr Bertens has already said this, - is very great if the USA continues to test and, above all, confidence in this treaty will be greatly undermined.
It must therefore be made clear: this treaty is valid and it must not be secretly destroyed by the USA's tests, for there is no international verification system by which it can be determined whether or not the test is subcritical.
Atomic weapons are weapons of mass destruction and the USA is demonstrating to us right now the methods it would use against weapons of mass destruction.
I am in any case of the opinion that it is absurd to use military methods and I prefer a diplomatic solution.
The EU must in this case prove its qualifications in the diplomatic sphere.
I hope that it now puts massive support behind making the agreement work.
I believe Mr Marin owes us an answer about exactly how this is going to happen.
