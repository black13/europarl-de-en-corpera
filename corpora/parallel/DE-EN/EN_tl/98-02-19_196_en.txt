Mr President, I had asked the Commissioner to tell us in concrete terms what the Commission plans.
Will the Commission make a proposal to the "Foreign Affairs' council, about how this test ban , on the assumption that everyone is ready to ratify it, even on w worldwide basis, can be implemented really effectively by everybody?
Is there in this respect a concrete proposal, is there a plan?
And when will the Commission present this to the Council?
