Mr President, I had already risen to speak.
I would like to support Colleague Ephremidis in his efforts on behalf of the flood victims but not in his demands to the President to declare such resolutions to be inadmissible.
It is my view that it is better for us to discuss the crime which actually exists all around buildings in Brussels - discussion on this was rejected - instead of a budget line which does not really exist.
I am of the opinion that it is not the President who should make such decisions but this House.
