Mr President, it is possible to keep the interests of consumers very clearly in view and yet at the same time be fully open to the possibilities of new technical developments.
Madame rapporteur has given us convincing proof of this by shedding bright light with her report on legal problems arising from the Commission's communication, - for example the question which has not yet been solved satisfactorily, about the definition of the methods of payment covered by the communication and\or a directive still to be drawn up.
Is this now to include only physical or also purely electronic payments - for instance via the Internet?
No less urgent are the liability problems dealt with in detail by the rapporteur, which are of prime importance for the consumer.
On both questions I consider a response from the Commission, also with regard to any directive which might be issued, to be urgently necessary.
The Committee on Legal Affairs passed the report by Mrs Thors unanimously.
It would be desirable if this high House could do the same - in the interests of the modernisation of our payment systems.
