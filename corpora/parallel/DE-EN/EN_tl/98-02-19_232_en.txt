Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the SLIM initiative is a very important initiative because it makes Europe pleasant.
Pleasant because people are thinking about how existing rules can be made simple and how they can be made more useful.
When one considers that we have about 50 000 single market regulations then one knows the magnitude of the task which has to be faced.
When they talk about new public management then we know that SLIM has a very significant role here.
In addition to FICHE-IMPACT which is to try to simplify new legal regulations and to make them clear for the benefit of citizens then SLIM is designed to simplify the existing statute book.
We also need the bench marking system, so that we can see how the quantity, the quality, the various spheres develop, in other words so that we get comparable criteria for how efficiently we work.
We need these SLIM programmes so that the single market does not just exist on paper but can also be experienced in practice.
Simplified and standardised single market regulations will benefit not only the companies, no, particularly the Consumers, because they will make it possible for products to be cheaper.
The firms can then be more concerned with delivering the service or manufacturing the product instead of with the entering of statistics.
It is in fact possible, to obtain the documents and the necessary data for the statistics from other spheres.
We give sufficient information to the Treasury, the banks can measure turnovers, the social security offices get the data.
I believe that in this sphere we have some scope.
I would also suggest that for example the Economic and Social Committee should concern itself more intensively with these problems, for relieving the load on business leads to more jobs.
