Madam President, Mrs Poisson, we are agreed on the essential point.
It is a good report and I don't want to go into detail but wish to concentrate on the disputed point to which my two amendments refer.
You know that the Commission told us in committee that we are concerned with a directive in which the open declaration is made.
At the time I doubted this and withdrew my amendments.
Now I have re-introduced them because I have meanwhile checked them and in so doing discovered that the Commission's statements are not correct.
The corresponding directive has been sent to the committee; I hope that my colleagues have had the opportunity to study them.
They in fact contain the following: there is an open declaration, but only in the sequence of the weight proportions, not in the percentages.
When it is a matter of domestic animal feeds - for canaries, cats and dogs, - then - as it states in the directive - the percentages must be given, but not in the case of farm animals, to which our directive now refers.
For that reason it is a matter of urgency, Mrs Poisson, that we accept these amendments, particularly since it is a question of a joint decision process.
If we do not accept them now we cannot get them back in the second process.
If what I say here does not correspond with the facts I am perfectly willing to take it back in the second reading.
But I am fairly sure that what I am telling you is sound and that we would be making a mistake if in this case we did not implement a declaration with percentages.
