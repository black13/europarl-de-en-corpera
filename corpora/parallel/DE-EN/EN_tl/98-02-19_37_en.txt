Madam President, can you ask the Commissioner if my statements, made in reference to the Commission's statements, are correct?
Then we need rather more clarification of the question.
The matter of the study is a completely different one.
This relates to the open declaration in the vase of feedingstuffs and we have agreed to wait for this study.
I want to know whether my statements are correct: then these amendments must be accepted.
This conclusion here is based on false statements by the Commission.
