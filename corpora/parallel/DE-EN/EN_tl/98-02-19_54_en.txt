Madam President, gene technological manipulation has nothing whatsoever to do with conquering world hunger.
We can only combat global hunger by offering those countries in which it prevails fair social development possibilities.
Sociologically it has long since been proved that there is a close connection between the population explosion and social emergency.
To use population growth as an argument in favour of the need for gene technologically manipulated foods is a pure and simple deception.
The same applies to the assertion that gene technological manipulation enables us to reduce the use of fertilizers.
I regard as particularly questionable Point 16 of the report which declares cross-frontier open experiments to be appropriate.
The promotion of communication for gene technological manipulation must also involve promoting the communication of information about the dangers of gene manipulation.
