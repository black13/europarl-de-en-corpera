Madam President, we have received reports about which we can be pleased and Mrs KeppelhoffWiechert has written a report which has a great future, which deals with a very responsible subject and is very ambitious.
I believe that food technology and in particular biotechnology have enormous influence on the people who sell food, on innkeepers and consumers.
Mrs Schierhuber has already referred to the fact that we need a good legal framework which makes it possible to produce these products without risk.
Labelling is a very important topic and I believe there is also a consensus here that marking must take place.
In principle we must say that there is no such thing as gene-free food.
In every food we consume there are genes and when today we eat various foods - vegetable, fruit, milk or meat - then these genes come together in our stomach and are digested there.
We also know that from foods which are made on a purely biological basis many illnesses can occur.
Dr Flande has shown in his latest book that food allergies can trigger off problems such as migraine, neuro-dermatitis, fungal infections, colds, asthma, chronic tiredness, obesity, itching, swelling, palpitation - all due to perfectly naturally produced foods.
We must see to it that we find foods with which we have a chance of remaining healthy.
That is an important task in which agriculture, the food distributors and ultimately the consumers must cooperate in order to be able to remain healthy in their old age.
