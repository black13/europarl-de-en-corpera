Madam President, I have no questions but I would like to sum up by saying thank you.
Time has moved on.
Most speakers have expressed themselves very positively indeed.
I hope that this is reflected at 12.00 in the vote.
I just wanted once more to reply to those who keep saying that it does not help the people in the developing countries.
Only yesterday afternoon we had a broad discussion here in the chamber in which the scientist Dr Klaus Amann refuted that very argument.
So, for example, in cooperation with research bodies in Europe and with organizations in the Philippines types of rice are being developed which promise the people there a better future.
To that extent I must again, being logical, reject it.
I must also say that for me ecological agriculture and gene technological do not represent a contradiction.
Thank you very much for all your work!
