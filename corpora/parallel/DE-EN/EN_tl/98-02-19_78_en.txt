Mr President, after this declaration by the Commission we must ask the rapporteur if she still has reservations about the matter.
For now, both our amendments make sense because they demand that the percentage share must be indicated.
Hitherto this was disputed by the Commission.
After this statement it is clear that our amendments are appropriate.
