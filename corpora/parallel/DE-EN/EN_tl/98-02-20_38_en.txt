Mr President, I would like to concern myself primarily with what Mrs Wemheuer said in her very nice speech to Mr Wynn, in which she emphasized that there are also human aspects to housekeeping.
Occasionally, as an emigrant from the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, I take part in sections of the Committee on Budgetary Control - unfortunately much too rarely, because our committees always meet at the same time, which is something I very much regret.
I can only say that I have experienced in the Budgetary Control Committee just how highly this work is valued, and that there is a human element there.
However, I would like to take issue with Mrs Wemheuer on one point.
She said this Friday sitting is somewhat less important.
No, look around, Mrs Wemheuer, and you can see that at least the quality is here.
The fact that there are spaces here and there is of no interest.
I am happy that we are finally deciding to send out a signal.
If you go out and talk to people, you see a growing suspicion of what our Community, our Union, is doing with the taxpayers' money.
I, too, share this suspicion, for why would someone refuse to accept our monitoring if they had nothing to hide?
The Council should be told.
I thank Mr Bosch, who raised this question earlier.
In that context I would say that this rejection is a clear signal sent by us to those gentlemen up there in the Council, and a policy which is correct, and we should of course ensure that it is made well known.
There is no doubt at all, this is a sign that the administration of the Fund is not working as it ought to.
Moreover, we should in no way give these unilateral Council decisions a dubious democratic legitimization, for the Council is the most undemocratic element in our Community.
(Applause)
