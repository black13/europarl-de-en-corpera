Mr President, we now have unanimous acceptance of a report in respect of which there were no amendments.
We have spent seven minutes voting on this minor matter - this does not relate to the contents but to the number of amendments.
I must say that this week it has been unbearable how we have had to proceed during the votes, with constant points of order in between.
I have intentionally not registered during these interruptions to the order of business in order not to delay any further.
However, in my capacity as one of the committee chairmen, who are of course responsible here for getting these resolutions through the House punctually, I must request most urgently that a tolerable solution is found in the Presidium now, as quickly as possible and certainly by the next plenary session, in order to eliminate these intolerable delays during the votes.
