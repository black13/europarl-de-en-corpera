Mr President, we vote in favour of this report, although I regard it as unnecessary automatically to attach the label of eastwards expansion to every sensible measure concerning our eastern neighbours.
I consider it important to emphasize that it is a matter of an agreement on participation between partners, and not a treaty on guaranteeing aid.
From my own experience I know that Austria's neighbouring country, the Slovak Republic, is especially very unhappy to be treated as a recipient of aid.
I am genuinely pleased that the rapporteur also deals in her statement with the very worrying situation of children in these countries.
It is particularly the children there who represent the population sector most at risk.
The UNICEF Report discussed last year by the European Parliament put this very forcefully and provided proof.
Socrates and Youth for Europe should therefore be used very specifically to improve the prospects and quality of life of children.
The most intensive cooperation between the educational institutions and the improvement of training systems will certainly contribute to the realization of the enormous intellectual and educational potential of Poland and the Slovak Republic, and ultimately of the citizens of the European Union.
