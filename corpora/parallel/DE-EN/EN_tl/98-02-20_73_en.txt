Mr President, I also thank Mrs Leperre-Verrier for her excellent report.
My group welcomes this report and the gradual opening of the programmes to the countries of central and eastern Europe prior to the entry of these countries.
Most of all, this represents another real door being flung wide open for young people to gain new experiences.
However, these programmes also offer the opportunity to exchange experiences in education and careers and to initiate an innovative dialogue, for these countries have something to offer us too.
So the principle of "Learn Your Neighbour's Language' does not just apply to the countries of western Europe, but it must also apply to our eastern neighbours.
This money is very well spent.
The transfer of knowledge and experience takes place nowhere more effectively than through personal experience and residence in the other country, and I very much hope that personal meetings eliminate prejudices which unfortunately exist today or are being preserved as in the olden days.
I could imagine that educational cooperation will one day lead to common teaching materials - perhaps even to a common European history book.
