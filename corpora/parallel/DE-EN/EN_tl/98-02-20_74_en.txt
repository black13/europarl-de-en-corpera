Mr President, I would very much like to join in the dance of those who are thanking Mrs Leperre-Verrier for the report and the work which she has done here.
One must indeed point out that this report belongs in a greater context.
Everything started with a report by Mr Posselt who at the time said that these reports must be extended to all the central and eastern European countries.
This is also worth mentioning, and very important.
We need only imagine the terribly short time available to these countries of central and eastern Europe, who were held back for so many decades under a Communist yoke, for making their short dash to catch up.
They are doing it in a really great way, inspiring us with enthusiasm.
One of the great philosophers of our century, the Dalai Lama, was once asked how he came to terms with the fact that there was still so much destruction and annihilation in the world - especially in his own country.
"At the moment we cannot do anything about it' , he said.
Really he is a very positive person indeed, and all his listeners were astonished.
Then he looked up and said, "Yes, but there is a possibility: we must win over the young people, for he who wins over the young people, to him will also belong the future.'
The same applies to this report.
This report turns to the young people - in this case in Poland and the Slovak Republic, previously (in fact last year) in Romania, Hungary and the Czech Republic.
If we win over the young people in these countries then the future of Europe belongs to them, which is what we want for them.
It is our task to show and suggest to these young people our European values, granted to us by 50 years of peace which have provided us with great prosperity, a great epoch, so that they can accept them of their own free will.
This report helps this to be achieved.
