Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, research, infrastructure and education are the bases for success for an eco-social market economy, for success, for employment.
So I welcome these programmes.
We members of the eastwards enlargement delegations did in fact have some very intensive discussions in the last week in Strasbourg with Commissioner van den Broek, and we made it clear that we particularly welcome the importance of this European agreement to include the central and eastern European states.
Of course, this applies especially to cooperation in the realm of education.
I would also like to emphasize, like the previous speaker Mr Posselt, that this is of very special significance for the aspect of integration, particularly from the time when the political situation in that country makes entry possible.
It is a well-known fact that the deadline for applications for the office of President expires today at 4 p.m. and the President is likely to be elected on 5 March.
It is interesting that President Kovac has applied, and that he will also arrange the referendum decided by the Constitutional Court.
So at the moment a very interesting development is unfolding in the Slovak Republic.
Precisely for that reason, we must do everything we can to give valuable assistance for this rapprochement.
Of course, many adaptations can be made from the outset.
Immediate integration into the Community's programmes should also be an expression of a strengthened introductory strategy.
The treaties of association with those countries which wish to join must be strengthened immediately, particularly with regard to the Slovak Republic.
The fact that we commence with cooperation in the fields of education and youth is not only to be welcomed but also well thought out.
I agree with the rapporteur: a common future in a common house called Europe can only be constructed in cooperation with young people.
