Mr President, I would like to go back to the discussion on crime in Brussels which we kept having in the course of the last part-session.
Assurances were given by the Presidency that appropriate talks would take place with the various offices in Brussels that might actually be able to do something about this.
We would be grateful if the House could be informed as to what sort of talks have taken place and what results these have produced.
Last week two more Members of Parliament, namely Mrs Pack and Mr Schiedermeier, were attacked.
I know about these two attacks but perhaps it has also happened to many more people.
It would not be an understatement to say today that this is an intolerable situation.
We have long since exceeded the level of what is acceptable.
I would be very grateful if this House could receive more information from the Presidency as to what is actually happening in these cases and what we can do to really increase safety in Brussels.
I would like to point out to all the Members that there is an oral motion available for signature and would ask them to sign it so that something can be actively done to combat this criminal behaviour in Brussels.
