Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we welcome the draft directive from the Commission in so far as it envisages at least a two-year guarantee.
That is a step in the right direction, but it is not enough.
It would be an improvement for countries at the bottom end of the EU like the Federal Republic, which only provides for an extremely short warranty period of six months.
But what we want is actually a breakthrough to sustainability in production, and that is why five years would be better in our view.
We need to get away from the disposable product mentality and the short life of goods and move towards sustainable production.
Manufacturers and distributors should not be released from responsibility either.
I have absolutely no sympathy with all the whining and whingeing letters we receive from industry.
Industry is always telling us it is prepared to accept responsibility.
I think manufacturers and distributors need to be called to account.
We therefore need to stem the flood of rubbish and demand a longer life for products.
That is why we have introduced an amendment providing for a 5-year guarantee, so as to finally achieve this breakthrough to sustainability.
This also enjoys the support of Finland, by the way, which makes it clear that even in the Council of Ministers there is support for sustainability in production.
We want to see that both the average life and the rate of consumption of products is disclosed with the manufacture and use of the product.
It is quite clear to us that repair must come first.
We want to put an end to the wasting of resources and create an incentive for curtailing production of non-recyclable goods.
We believe that with this directive the European Parliament needs to come clean at the vote tomorrow as to just how serious it is about sustainability in production.
