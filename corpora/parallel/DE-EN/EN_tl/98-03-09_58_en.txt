Madam President, I do not have a script, just two observations.
There is no competence of the European Parliament for coordinating civil law.
There is no coordination taking place, as it happens.
Only minimum standards are being set down, i.e. we will probably be left legally with a patched-up job.
Where then is the coordination that might perhaps be still justified?
I do not believe, incidentally, that within the European Union of the single market there has ever been a cross-border purchase made or omitted simply because another warranty system operates in the other country.
That is an utterly ridiculous assumption.
One other word, on the shift in the burden of proof, since I cannot say more about the substance.
This has become something of a magic formula: ' shift in the burden of proof.'
It is quite clear that we can do nothing to change the facts of the matter, namely that the one who asserts a claim has to prove the facts justifying the claim, and a reversal in the burden of proof can only come into it if the one making the claim has absolutely no access to the information justifying his claim.
Only then can shifting the burden of proof be considered.
This clearly is not the case here.
This shift in the burden of proof means that fundamentally the seller can never produce the proof.
He took his iron that was all packed up down from the shelf and gave it the customer - and then three months later he is expected to prove that this iron was in order.
Legally this is rather suspect.
