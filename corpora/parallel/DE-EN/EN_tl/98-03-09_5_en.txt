Mr President, I refer to Friday's Minutes, where you wrote in a letter to me: ' rest assured that I share your concern and shall do my utmost with the Belgian authorities to find a satisfactory solution where the safety of the Members and staff of the European Parliament is concerned.'
I would like to express my thanks for these kind words.
I would also like to state that I have completed a survey of my own.
A colleague of mine was in over 300 offices, in more than half the offices of Members of the European Parliament.
She told me that exactly one third of the offices had given accounts of criminal incidents in Brussels.
I would also like to inform you that the perpetrators of the attack against my assistant were apprehended and appeared in a line-up this week.
I therefore thank you for your efforts in this area!
