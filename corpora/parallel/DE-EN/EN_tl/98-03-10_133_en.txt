Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, road safety is a complex, interdisciplinary business, encompassing a wide variety of technical and above all human factors.
My main reaction to Mr Cornelissen's excellent report is a very positive one, but I do have some concerns.
I am pleased at the number of important and fundamental suggestions and practical proposals for improving road safety.
I personally feel that an improvement is urgently needed not just because it can be shown that the annual economic cost of road accidents is over 100 billion ECU, not to mention the unquantifiable and immeasurable human suffering involved, but because like anyone else I would like to feel safe on the roads of neighbouring countries.
This also applies when help is needed after an accident.
I have had very good first-hand experience, in a state that fortunately no longer exists, of doing a first aid course as part of learning to drive.
I am concerned to see signs that the proposed action programme may lead to powers not provided for under the EC Treaty, with legally binding decisions being taken at European level.
Surely voluntary agreements would do the job just as well without a flood of red tape and regulations.
I would only recommend voting for the report if six of the seven amendments to be voted on tomorrow are rejected, and only if I am sure that Paragraphs 7b and 7e, which can be summed up as 'rigid maximum speed limits' and 'introduction of a panEuropean penalty system' , do not get through.
