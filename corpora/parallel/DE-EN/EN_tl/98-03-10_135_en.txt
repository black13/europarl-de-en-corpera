Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I very much welcome the Commission's initiative to launch an action programme to promote road safety in the EU.
The high death toll on Europe's roads is appalling, and something must be done about it.
We should all be interested in cutting the number of accidents.
Drunken driving is one of the most common causes of accidents.
That is why there should be a maximum blood alcohol limit of 0.5 mg/ml for drivers.
Austria has already introduced such a limit.
However, it is not just alcohol that impairs people's fitness to drive, medicines and drugs can also affect it.
This should be reflected in legislation and we must adopt measures to tackle this problem.
Strict and consistent controls on road-users are essential.
Monitoring of speed restrictions is a priority here.
With regard to the disqualification of drivers and Europe-wide recognition of this disqualification, we need to remember that there has been no pan-European harmonization of legal systems, which is an essential requirement for this.
Unless administrative and legal provisions are harmonized across Europe, there can be no question of reciprocal recognition of disqualification, as the conditions for disqualification vary so widely from one Member State to another.
