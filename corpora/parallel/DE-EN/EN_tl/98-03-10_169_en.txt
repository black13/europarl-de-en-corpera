Madam President, we too welcome the debate on this report.
With a few exceptions we also find it a very interesting and highly intelligent piece of work.
Of course it would be good if the environmental, social and structural conditions prevailing in Europe and the West applied to the rest of the world, so that investors had to respect them worldwide.
Unfortunately it is somewhat arrogant of the West smugly to ignore the needs and living conditions of the third world and dream up obstacles to investment that ultimately prevent economic conditions from improving elsewhere on our planet.
There is no denying that modernization of infrastructure and communications systems throughout the world has created enormous competition for inward investment.
Investors acting on behalf of their shareholders will always pick those locations which promise the most profit.
Trying to protest or legislate against this process would be the modern equivalent of smashing up machines during the industrial revolution.
The question that the report does not resolve is how Europe can play its part in securing an economic upturn in the third world without laying down the law to how this upturn is to be achieved.
The restrictions that would apply in the area of culture are a problem.
I can only refer to the Dutch government's report, which says 'Don't get yourself a suit of armour, stiffen your backbone instead' .
The measures for regulating foreign investment called for in the report must not, however, be allowed to generate a situation in which open competition is possible in every area of culture.
The same people who were critical of American companies getting their hands on EU money would certainly have nothing against American companies putting money into European films.
I particularly welcome the part of the report on the threat to copyright.
We have a lot of catching up to do in this area, and this needs detailed examination.
