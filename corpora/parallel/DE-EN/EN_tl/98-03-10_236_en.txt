Mr President, Mrs Sch√∂rling, first of all I can confirm that Sweden was indeed granted derogations as part of its accession to the European Community.
In accordance with these derogations - and this also applies to Finland by the way - Sweden can apply special guarantees to various products, namely fresh meat, eggs and poultry meat, as the Commission authorized operational programmes for combatting salmonella submitted by Sweden.
The Commission approved these programmes in its 1995 decision.
We will be coming back to the subject of checking in the next question, but the essential point is that a procedure certainly exists under which countries of dispatch are responsible, as the Commission cannot check every consignment shipped from every Member State on the spot.
The Commission can only ensure that appropriate rules exist.
The Member State concerned is of course then required to ensure that these rules are observed.
