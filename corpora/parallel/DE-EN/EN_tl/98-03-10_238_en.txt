Mr President, I am pleased to answer this question because it leads on to the Commission's general policy in this area.
As you will probably know, we have started to review the whole area of meat hygiene and all legislation in this field.
Our goal in doing so is as follows: on the one hand, we want to establish clear Community rules governing checks necessary from the beginning of the production chain for a foodstuff right to the consumer's table.
But in doing so, we want to break new ground with the HACCP system.
Under this system, private processing companies are involved in the actual checking work, while they in turn are subject to checks by the appropriate authorities, so that the checking work stipulated is also monitored.
This is the approach on which the FAO has agreed.
It is an approach supported by the World Health Organization and I think that we are definitely on the right track here.
Of course we must ensure that the requirements we are imposing on our own farms and factories also apply to third countries, so that exactly the same criteria are applicable to imports.
For example, exactly the same system will be required for imports under the bilateral agreement currently being discussed with the USA.
