I am not in a position to give any answer at all to questions about a specific region and its future level of support, because we have not even agreed the proposals for the new Structural Fund Regulations within the Commission yet, and even then the support system will be far more partnership-oriented, and thus based on both European and national criteria.
I cannot tell you now what proposals the British government will choose to implement.
I am afraid I therefore have to disappoint you.
