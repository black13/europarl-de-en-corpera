I know that the European Union cannot clear up all the problems in the Community with Structural Funds money.
I am also all too well aware that a few changes in the regions can also lead to problems.
But I hope you will understand that in proposing generous measures for Objective 1, 2 and 5b areas for phasing out regions that will in future no longer be eligible, we really want to do what is necessary to consolidate existing successes.
Again, I want to make it quite clear that KONVER areas, like all other initiatives, will continue to qualify for Objective 3 funds, that is for the training of the unemployed and people faced with unemployment.
I assume that in future this could be of real help in precisely this area.
One last comment.
Community initiatives as a whole, as you can see from the utilization rates, have not been as successful as we hoped, which is another reason for integrating such measures.
The defence industry is also 'industry' , of course.
As long as the relevant criteria are met, Objective 2 support is also available.
If these criteria are not satisfied, there is still horizontal Objective 3.
