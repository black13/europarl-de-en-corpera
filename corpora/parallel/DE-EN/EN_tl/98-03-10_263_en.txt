The Commission decisions granting approval to individual URBAN programmes also contain the rules for those programmes.
I will also briefly mention them by name, because I think it is better to talk about specifics than regulation numbers.
URBAN has Objective 1 and Objective 2 monitoring committees, which are the general monitoring committees for Objective 1 and Objective 2.
Outside the assisted regions, and this is where Bristol comes in, I understand that there is an independent monitoring committee.
I have to agree with you that the process is somewhat complicated, as this monitoring committee is advised by the URBAN management committee, which is a sub-committee for monitoring the management of non-Objective areas, and there is also an URBAN partnership group, which brings together local partners and non-governmental organizations.
