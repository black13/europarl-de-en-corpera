Firstly, as an ultraperipheral region, the Azores will continue to be part of the most heavily assisted group of regions.
Secondly, I assume that the other regions you mentioned will also continue to receive financial assistance from the European Union.
The problem with the Structural Funds is that they are not an emergency aid mechanism and that the European Union has abolished emergency aid within Europe.
So we have no means of offering specific emergency aid.
However, what we can do in the case of an emergency, and have in fact done in Portugal, is to divert money available under the Community Support Frameworks and to use it for economic regeneration and to mitigate the environmental damage caused by such disasters.
That is what we have done in this case.
We certainly need to discuss how INTERREG 2C can be used more in the southern Member States in future to combat flooding.
I would ask you to remember how long we discussed how to combat droughts effectively, and that despite that neither the Commission nor perhaps the Portuguese government were farsighted enough to incorporate appropriate preventive measures in their plans for INTERREG 2C and Portugal.
I hope, however, that this will not be needed in the future, and if it is, we should be flexible enough to reconsider our programmes.
I do believe, however, that the funds we are making available are really an enormous extra help to these regions in coping with the aftermath of the emergencies.
