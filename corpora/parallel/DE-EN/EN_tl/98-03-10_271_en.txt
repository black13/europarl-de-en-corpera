The Commission normally has no right of say in bilateral negotiations, not only because of subsidiarity, but also because in the interests of sovereignty Member States do not normally welcome Commission poking its nose into things that Member States can sort out better themselves.
However, we have not been mere bystanders here.
For example, we financed a joint Spanish/Portuguese study to get the facts on their common water resources.
Furthermore, when authorization for the dam was being sought, we took the opportunity to ensure that joint water management was proposed as part of the plans to ensure that sufficient water of acceptable quality reached the dam.
I assume that the authorization and the precautions taken were helpful in this respect.
