Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at second reading we are concerned today with the minimum requirements for ships which are using the Community's ports and carrying dangerous or environmentally harmful goods.
I think we are dealing here with an extremely important subject, which causes people to react once something has happened.
The aim of our legislation is to ensure that there will never be a catastrophic accident, or if an accident should occur, that possible damage is kept to a minimum, so that the people are not preoccupied with this subject.
I think there has rarely been a better starting point for European legislation.
I would like to thank the rapporteur explicitly for dealing so seriously with this subject, both at first reading and now at second reading.
The Group of the European People's Party shares the rapporteur's view.
We support all the amendments tabled, especially the request that appropriate information is also made available about ships which transport dangerous goods, do not use EU ports, but which do sail through the territorial waters of the European Union.
It is not just a question of accidents associated with the entering or leaving of ports but of the broadest possible measures to avert risks, even if it is only territorial waters which are affected, because experiences in recent years show that there really can be problems on European soil without a ship having initially entered a European port.
I would therefore strongly urge the Commission to take up this matter of concern.
We are unfortunately only at the cooperation stage.
The Treaty of Amsterdam is not yet in force, otherwise we would be more deeply involved in the legislative process.
I therefore request that you really do take up this matter, so that we can find a solution to the benefit of all the people in Europe.
