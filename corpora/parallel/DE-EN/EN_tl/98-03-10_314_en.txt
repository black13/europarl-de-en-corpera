Madam President, let me make four comments during my one minute.
Firstly, the example of BSE shows how quickly rare diseases can develop into catastrophes.
Secondly, one can see from the arrogance of the Commission how quickly it can foster that kind of development, because we received notice that research on BSE had to wait until it was considered appropriate to put together a programme for rare diseases.
Thirdly, when it is a question of rare diseases, industry is not interested, because one to one million is not worthwhile for a medicine.
Fourthly, consequently, we urgently need a programme at European level, which researches these rare diseases and gets to grips with them, thus limiting the possible impact, namely an epidemic, as we have seen in the case of BSE.
