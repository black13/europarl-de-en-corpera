Mr President, today we are discussing practical safeguards involved in introducing the euro, which means we also need to address the protection of consumers' rights.
Dual pricing during the transition period is an absolute must, and should not be optional as envisaged in the report.
Businesses' concern to have as much leeway as possible with labelling should not mean that consumer interests are pushed to one side.
By ensuring transparency, dual pricing can reassure consumers during a period of uncertainty.
Dual pricing can even give businesses a competitive advantage, if it means they can gain consumers' confidence.
Even if the European Banking Association and the European Savings Banks Group recently agreed not to pass conversion costs on to their customers, we must watch that this promise is honoured.
If you read the text carefully, you will in fact see that the banking associations are only talking about ensuring a smooth and fair changeover for customers.
So the message is not really that the changeover will be cost-free for consumers.
I therefore welcome a code of behaviour for the banking and finance sector.
I was struck by the rapporteur's statement that special tax treatment for investment in connection with the introduction of the euro could lead to distortions in competition within a given sector or in relation to other sectors.
I say this because just a few days ago, I was reading in an Austrian newspaper about precisely that point being made by an Austrian bank.
I therefore think it is important to demand equal rights for all, to coin a phrase.
But it will also be up to Member States' legislatures to safeguard this.
