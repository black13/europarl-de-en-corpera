Mr President, I would like to refer to Item 2 of the Minutes of yesterday's sitting, and return to the subject of crime in Brussels.
It states here that the President said this item should not actually have been in the Minutes, although it was certainly in the Minutes for the Friday of the last part-session.
The President also mentioned that he would inform the two signatories of the request for a topical and urgent debate in writing.
Could the Bureau please consider whether this could not be debated here in plenary?
We know that over a third of Members have been victims of criminal acts in Brussels, so that this really affects everyone and not just one or two people in this House.
I really think it is high time something was done about this in Parliament.
