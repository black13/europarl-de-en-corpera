Madam President, on a point of order, I would like to say that two anti-crime procedures are currently under way.
The first is the request for urgent debate before Parliament and the second is the referral to the Council.
The request can be signed here in the Palais in Room 1155, next to the Documentation Service.
Thirdly, I would like to ask if the Committee on the Rules of Procedure has already dealt with the refusal of the request for urgent debate at the last sitting.
