Mr President, Mr President of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the challenge set us by the enlargement of the European Union lies in determining whether or not we can shape the process in a spirit of partnership and without tensions.
It requires changes on both sides.
Whilst the EU itself has introduced the necessary reforms in a somewhat faltering and half-hearted manner, the reforms it is demanding of the applicant countries are complex and farreaching and involve a full calendar of legislative and administrative amendments.
However, both sides must play their part in ensuring that the economic and political integration of the countries of Eastern Europe results in a high level of social and economic benefits for all the countries involved.
Enlargement should not be limited to economic integration alone.
It must also play a part in consolidating democracy in the newly independent countries and achieving greater social justice for the people living in them.
The first thing that we have to do is put our own house in order and really accelerate our own internal reforms.
The first step towards achieving this - as other members of this House have already clearly underlined - should be the mandatory involvement of Parliament in the enlargement process.
This would also mean that the reform would be structured in a spirit of partnership and that the burden would fall on both sets of shoulders, for we know that the failure of enlargement would not only undermine the economic and democratic development of Eastern Europe, but that it would also do serious damage to the image of the Union as a model of peaceful, economic and political integration.
For this reason, our task, the task of the Council, the Commission and Parliament, is not to allow enlargement to deteriorate and become a one-way street, but to ensure that it is a political success.
