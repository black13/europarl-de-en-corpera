Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this has been a very impressive exercise in political semantics.
Not that I wish to say that we managed to decipher all of what it means.
This talk of a third way must be taken seriously.
But where is it leading?
Surely it cannot be the third way between the continental European welfare capitalism of the post-war period and today's deregulated US-style capitalism or, in other words, a pretty term for the further deregulation, privatization and micro-economization of our society.
Here I have some real questions.
I am somewhat surprised that in this context the internal market is so glibly referred to as a success.
Undoubtedly there have been some success stories, but the mass unemployment, polarization of the regions, new poverty, social exclusion and the disenfranchisement - a term for which I have no equally elegant German equivalent -, affecting large parts of our population are surely signs of a structural crisis which we are very far from controlling.
I listened with interest to the talk of a fair deal, even of a new deal.
In the Green group, we have been talking about the sort of socio-ecological new deal which we need for years.
However, our new deal would open up a third way not between the two classical forms of capitalist economy, but between a continued form of capital accumulation and democratic responsibility for the ecological sustainability and socially cohesive development of the societies of Europe.
This would represent a model and an incentive for the rest of the world and not a sort of neo-imperialism as the current newspeak would have it.
