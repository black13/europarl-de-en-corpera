Mr President, I think there are two very important points here.
The first point is the SLIM initiative.
SLIM is intended to reduce the burden on business.
Do you think it would be possible to get the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy or the Committee of the Regions involved in the SLIM Programme as well, so that these Committees could concentrate most of their efforts on SLIM projects?
The second point is the fiche d'impact .
I have the documents for today's sitting here.
We now have an extremely comprehensive set of documents to work through in the European Parliament.
I think it would also be useful to consider items in the legislative process that could be simplified.
Fiche d'impact is, therefore, an excellent operating principle.
Does the Presidency have any plans to launch more initiatives in this area in future?
