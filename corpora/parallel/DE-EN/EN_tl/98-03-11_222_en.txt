Madam President, it is a pleasure to listen to you.
It is very enjoyable indeed!
Your political eloquence is very impressive indeed.
I have two short questions.
You have given here an impressive description of the model which you call the new model of competition, of fair competition.
In your opinion should this involve an initiative at international level, such as that which Sir Leon Brittan has been seeking for a long time?
Would you be in favour of this?
My second question refers to another complex matter, namely to what we call electronic trade.
As you know, there is an initiative at European and American level in this field.
In your view, how far should the European initiative be extended?
To what extent should our approach differ from what is happening at US and international level, and what would be a successful model for the future?
I would like to make a final brief remark.
I would just like to remind you, Mrs Moreau, that the proposal presented by Leon Brittan this morning was requested by this Parliament.
We have commented on it here in the House and it has been adopted in my committee, the Committee on External Economic Relations.
Parliament has approved it with an overwhelming majority.
