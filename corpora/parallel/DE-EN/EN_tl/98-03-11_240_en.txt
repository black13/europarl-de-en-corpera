Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, I would like to ask you whether you agree that in the case of Israel we are dealing with a stable democracy which has renounced terrorism, whereas we have not had an equivalent renunciation on the part of the Palestinians, and whether you agree that there is no necessity for us to go teaching lessons to the Israeli government.
It is not my impression that Israel has unilaterally denounced the Oslo process, or do you see a different policy?
I would also stress that I would be pleased to see the admonitions addressed to Israel also addressed to the Palestinians.
