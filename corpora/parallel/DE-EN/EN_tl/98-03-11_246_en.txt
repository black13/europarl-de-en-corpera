Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, many thanks for your concern and for your answer.
My question is as follows: do you not share my view that the Commission's answer, that its proposal still smacks of the spirit of protectionism.
With customs fines set at £50, £200 and £500 per tonne of bananas, it is easy to believe this to be the case.
And do you not share my view that since yesterday's European Court judgement the situation has changed completely?
You will be aware that the framework agreement between the EU and the four Central American bananaproducing countries was declared invalid.
This presents us with a completely new situation.
Under the terms of the judgement, the market organization must be rectified and as a result I am asking now whether you at long last, and sooner rather than later, intend to stop this madness with an initiative which will look very different from that suggested by the Commission here.
