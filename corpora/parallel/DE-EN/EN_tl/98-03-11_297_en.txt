Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, in July 1997 an application was made in the House of Commons by representatives of both main parties examining the method of suffrage used at both national elections and European elections in Gibraltar.
In response to a question which I asked a month ago, I was informed that this matter is still pending.
I am not sure whether this is still the case or what the present situation is.
Am I right in assuming, on the basis of your comments and the legal basis you have just mentioned, that this question is probably invalid in the House of Commons anyway, since the point at issue is not itself legally feasible in practical terms.
The second question which I should like to add relates to the matter of Gibraltar which - as you already know from the Treaty of Utrecht - is basically split into two parts, the matter of the rock and the matter of the isthmus.
I would like to know how you regard the two parts.
