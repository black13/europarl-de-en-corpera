Mr President, I am sorry.
You have probably answered this question already.
I had to attend the meeting of the EU-Czech Republic Joint Parliamentary Committee.
That is why I am late.
I simply wanted to ask why Question Time ended before 7.00 pm today.
In principle, Question Time should run until 7.00 pm.
I also wanted to ask whether it started on time.
