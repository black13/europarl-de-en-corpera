Mr President, every year Parliament receives a report on the demographic situation in the Union.
It is right and proper that population development should be a matter for constant observation, since the policy directions of the future depend on the recognition of current population trends.
Not for the first time, the report points to the gradual increase in the percentage of elderly people in our population.
The measures proposed to counter this trend are well known.
We also know that the pension and health systems need to be adapted accordingly.
At the same time, however, we know that the decreasing number of contributors, the increase in expenditure on public health systems and the tightening of budgets in response to the convergence criteria are difficult to reconcile.
But the longer these problems remain unsolved, the more difficult they become and, above all, the more difficult they are to finance.
We must ask ourselves, therefore, whether this is the right approach to finding a solution, given that the inequality between supply and demand in the regional labour markets is to be balanced by means of initiatives to facilitate migration.
My ideas are based on a model of society which places the family at the centre of things and does not therefore see the solution to diminishing birth rates in an increased influx of migrants.
