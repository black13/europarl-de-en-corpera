Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur, not only for his report as a whole, but also for his contributions today in which he has so clearly highlighted Ukraine's great significance for the economic and political stability of the whole of Europe.
It is for this reason that we must be prepared to give aid to Ukraine, despite the fact that there are serious problems there as Mrs Hoff's report has shown, and that we also have problems of our own here in the European Union.
In this context, I think it is very important to look in greater detail at two of the points made in the report.
The first point concerns the death penalty in Ukraine.
I find it unacceptable that Ukraine signed the Convention on Human Rights, indeed that it promised to abolish the death penalty and that despite this, as the report clearly shows, 13 death sentences were carried out last year.
It is simply a situation which we should not accept.
We are judging Ukraine by different standards too simply because it wants to look European.
This point is also particularly important because we are currently witnessing a renaissance of the death penalty in many countries in eastern Europe where there is political pressure either to retain the death penalty, or to reintroduce it for certain cases.
It is important that we bring the European Union's role in setting standards to bear in our dealings with Ukraine.
My second point relates to the energy policy.
I am convinced, as point 18 of Mr Titley's report states, that we must help to make Chernobyl reasonably safe.
But I am quite adamantly against point 19 because it is simply an attempt to replace one evil by another, that is, to close Chernobyl but to build new nuclear power stations.
That is completely the wrong route and in my view it is a waste of every ECU invested in this misguided energy policy.
I hope that the amendments which have been tabled on this point will prove successful in tomorrow morning's vote.
