Mr President, as many of my fellow Members have already said, the forceful and encouraging words "action plan' refer to an unassuming group of measures which are already in existence, not to anything new.
If we are to develop this idea into more than an electoral aid, if we are to allow it to mature into a plausible concept, in my view, we have to let Ukraine know that the enlargement of the European Union must be a flexible process and it must not be limited to the current waiting list of countries.
As the first country to have rid itself of its nuclear weapons potential, Ukraine must be integrated into a European security system which has as its objective a Europe free of nuclear weapons.
In contrast to the action plan, priority must be given to the strengthening of "civil society' and the building up of democracy.
That is the only proper basis for economic reform.
Finally, in a country which lives every day with the threat of radioactive contamination, European aid must promote alternative sources of energy, not create new dangers.
For this reason we call for the modification of the EU strategy on Ukraine.
