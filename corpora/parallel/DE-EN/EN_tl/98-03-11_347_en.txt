Mr President, Madam Commissioner, would you please tell your colleagues in the Commission, in particular Mr van den Broek, that there will be no respite for the Commission in April, and that one of the reasons for this is Mrs Hoff's report which we are discussing today.
I should like to make it quite clear to them that personally I am more involved in Bosnia.
But TACIS in Ukraine is not the only problem.
Reconstruction in Bosnia is not the only problem.
The underspending of PHARE appropriations is not the only problem.
In fact, the main problem is GD Ia and the Commission's complete inability to deal with the constraints of time.
Allow me to quote from Mrs Hoff's report, "...motivation is at a low ebb in GD Ia' .
I could say the same thing about Bosnia when I see how my colleagues are working in Sarajevo.
There is no strategic vision.
The same is true of Bosnia!
The Commission has a hopelessly unrealistic approach to the problems of Ukraine.
I can only agree!
And not only on that point, but also on may other aspects of external policy for which Mr van den Broek is responsible.
I want to tell you what the consequences are.
It is damaging not only to the reputation of the European Union; it is damaging in terms of both nuclear safety in Ukraine and reconstruction in Bosnia.
But much worse, it is damaging in very concrete terms to the people on the spot who are hoping for our help and who are expecting specific and effective help.
Please, Madam Commissioner, would you be so kind as to ask Mr van den Broek to tell this House when and how he intends to accept responsibility, without making the excuse that the Council of Minsters also has a certain level of responsibility to bear, just like any other project partner anywhere else in the world!
That is certainly the case, but ultimately he is responsible.
