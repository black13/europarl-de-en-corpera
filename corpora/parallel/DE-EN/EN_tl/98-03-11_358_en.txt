Mr President, on the subject of consumer protection and its legal possibilities, I should like to address a wider issue: the current situation with regard to animal feed.
Since 1 April 1997 it has been obligatory to administer animal feed in accordance with a specific regulation.
Although this is a matter of Community law, it is not being applied by the Member States.
Our view - which I would like to discuss for the first time this evening - is that where consumers' health is threatened the Commission must have the right to intervene and withdraw from circulation any product that might prove dangerous.
In the case of BSE it is clear the origin lies in contaminated animal feed.
However, the Commission is unable to intervene.
We have asked the legal service of the European Parliament and the Commission to do something in this regard so that we can take a political initiative, so that the Commission can take action against the Council which is failing to observe its own laws in the Member States, to ensure that consumer protection measures can be implemented in the various areas.
