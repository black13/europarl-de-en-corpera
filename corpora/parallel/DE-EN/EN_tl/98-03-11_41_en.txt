Mr President, I would like to make two points in relation to this debate.
We are on the eve of an important development in Europe, the enlargement process, which will undoubtedly occupy us - as Mr Spencer has quite rightly pointed out - for the next ten or fifteen years or possibly even longer since it will not end with the current eleven applicants.
There will always be several countries queueing up to get into the European Union.
It is absolutely vital that the European Parliament, as the directly elected representative of the peoples of Europe, has a continuous and regulated involvement in this process, rather than appearing to give the process free rein initially but ultimately making a pronouncement about whether the outcome is acceptable.
I therefore share the view that Parliament should be involved during the lead-in phase and during the accession agreements.
On the other hand, I should like to prevent the European Parliament giving the wrong signal.
We should not be slamming doors in the faces of the candidates even before the enlargement process has started.
Therefore, I hope that we will be able to reach a compromise in this matter.
(The President cut off the speaker)
