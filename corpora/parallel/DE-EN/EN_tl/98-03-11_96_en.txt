Mr President, you decided to continue with the vote although there was considerable noise in this room.
Since this vote, which contained some roll-call votes, relates to a sensitive area and since it was preceded by numerous discussions, because of the noise neither yourself as President nor the translation could be heard.
I would therefore request that you admit Mr Kellett-Bowman's motion and start the vote again.
It was impossible to hear which vote you called and what the result of the vote was.
