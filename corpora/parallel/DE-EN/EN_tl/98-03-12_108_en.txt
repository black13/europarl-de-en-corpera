Mr President, President Meciar is playing with fire.
A sure sign of this is the cancellation of the planned referendum and the brutal shake-out of over half of his ambassadors.
Although he may well be acting within the framework of his formal powers, he is revealing a problematic relationship with the culture of the constitutional state and democracy in general.
What we want is for the elections to be prepared properly from now on and to be conducted fairly and for the media to have all the freedom they need to cover such an important situation.
Otherwise we would have to join the other groups in calling for the complete suspension of European Union aid to Slovakia.
