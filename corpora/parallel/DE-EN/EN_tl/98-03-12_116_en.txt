Mr President, on 11 February this year the vice-president of the Cambodian parliament, Mr Son Soubert, let slip in a private conversation that he thought the way the present prime minister seized power last year amounted to a coup d'Ã©tat.
The result was soon in evidence.
Legal action was taken against him, his immunity was removed, the case is being heard and he will soon be on his way to prison.
Today we have learned that the Cambodian government led by Hun Sen has also decided to do more to exclude the smaller parties from the election.
This is the situation we currently have in Cambodia and it is, unfortunately, in the very sad tradition of this country.
However, it would be very questionable if we now took a risk and said that the Commission, and therefore the European Union, was willing to give Cambodia a sum of ECU 10.5 million in aid to fight the elections.
It would be questionable firstly because in practice we would not be maintaining solidarity with a lot of other countries who say that they could not give out money to this kind of dictatorial regime - most other countries do not give out money anyway; and secondly, we would be skating on very thin ice as this could be seen as setting a precedent for other countries.
However, the main reason is that the Commission has let it be known that the money will be paid out in any event, even if certain parties - including the party of democratically elected Prince Ranariddh - are not allowed to take part in the elections.
We could be establishing a very bad precedent here and we should be careful.
We should be trying to get the Commission to reconsider the allocation of this money or to write a report on Cambodia in the course of the next one or two months to see whether it is sensible to actually pay this money.
