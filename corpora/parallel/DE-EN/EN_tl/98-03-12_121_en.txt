Mr President, elections should be taking place in Cambodia on 26 July 1998 and perhaps they still will.
The Commission has set aside ECU 9.5 million by way of aid.
Cambodia signed the peace agreement in 1991.
I think we all hoped that these elections would become democratic elections.
Over the past few months we have discussed Cambodia a lot, condemning the increasing violence and condemning the fact that the second prime minister, Hun Sen, seized power.
As things stand at the moment, it looks to me as if he is leading the country into a new dictatorship.
We therefore have to ask the Commission what it intends to do with the election aid, this ECU 9.5 million, which after all is presumably tax money.
We in the budgetary authority had hoped - just as the Commission had hoped - that this money would be used to ensure fair and free elections.
Will this money still be paid, Commissioner, or not?
In my opinion, we should link it to political conditions to the effect that the political leaders of all parties can return, their return is permitted, free elections are held, there is freedom of assembly, independence of the judiciary is guaranteed and a debate is held at the ASEM summit among the ASEAN countries and between ASEM members and the governments of the European Union on the future of Cambodia and these elections or the pace of democratization.
