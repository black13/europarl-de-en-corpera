Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, once again Colombia is on the agenda and once again this is very painful for us in Parliament given our good relations with Latin America and Latin American politicians, including those in Colombia's.
Let me make two brief remarks on yet another tragic case of a human rights worker being murdered, this time even in his own office.
This is really one of the most dramatic instances of contempt for human rights.
A short time ago, Colombia elected a new government - senate and parliament.
I do not know all the individual results but I do not think there are any significant changes.
At this point we should be clearly saying to the newly elected members that we here will still be watching to see how they support an independent judiciary in their country, capable of prosecuting this crime since that does not just depend on the government, it also depends on the parliament.
They should know that we are monitoring events very closely here!
Yesterday I read in an article in a serious German daily newspaper that the subject of Colombia is also on the agenda in the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva.
The mandate of the United Nations Observer Mission there, which the EU supports, is to be extended and the number of staff doubled.
While that is a positive move on our part, it unfortunately bears out the negative findings.
All we can say is that the government must be called upon again and again to take action against these murders, as whoever is committing them must know that violence only begets more violence, particularly in a country where violence is a daily event.
The defenders of human rights must be better protected if human rights in Columbia are ever to be given the status they deserve.
