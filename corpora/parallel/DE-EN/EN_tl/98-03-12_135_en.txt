Mr President, there is no doubt that of all the Central American countries Nicaragua has long been one of the most pleasant and one of the most tragic.
I myself have been to Nicaragua and have seen the situation there for myself.
Nicaragua suffered a really terrible civil war, of which we were very often shown a misleading picture here.
In spite of this, the people of Nicaragua have actually managed to bring a responsible liberal democrat party to power in the form of the present government and in particular its current head of state, President Alam√°n.
What is more, the relatively revolutionary Sandinista party have now chosen the way of democracy and freedom, which became evident during the current crisis surrounding Ortega.
From this perspective we can say one thing: it is simply not logical for Nicaragua to be one of the world's poorest countries.
Anyone who has been there knows that there is massive potential there; anyone who has been there knows that the people there are precious and we should do everything in our power to help the Nicaraguans out of this situation, especially under the leadership of its current president.
The only way we can achieve this is by relieving the burden of debt.
I am not saying that it should be written off completely as that would be wrong but we should do all we can to give the Nicaraguans the opportunity to actually build up their country, to develop the great resources that exist there - and these are first and foremost human resources - and, above all, to pursue policies that are consistent with this country's great cultural Spanish tradition.
