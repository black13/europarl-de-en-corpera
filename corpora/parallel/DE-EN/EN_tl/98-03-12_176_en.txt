Madam President, the cultural, the social and indeed the commercial importance of sport is, I believe, beyond dispute.
The way that a football world championship binds peoples together has a quite special significance.
People retain memories of what happened there for the rest of their lives.
I therefore find it completely incomprehensible that the organizing committee for such an event uses a discriminatory ticket distribution system that gives preference to the citizens of its own country.
As the Commissioner has already remarked, the European Parliament is currently dealing with the second report on citizenship of the Union and is trying to find ways and means of making people feel European.
At the same time, sport, which already leads a rather modest existence in relation to its importance within the European Union, is being done a great disservice and a wedge is being driven between citizens of the Union.
In short, I can only regret that, if I have understood the Commissioner correctly, there is no possibility of straightening out the situation pro praeterito .
However, I must agree with the previous speakers and ask that we be informed of what is planned to prevent such things happening in future.
