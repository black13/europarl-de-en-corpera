Madam President, the increasing levels of international crime make it necessary to consider ways of putting a stop to this trend.
The different material and judicial requirements, the complicated provisions of mutual judicial assistance arrangements and the stipulation for punishment in both countries are cited as the cause of problems in connection with cross-border criminal proceedings.
As a practitioner of many years' standing, I support any simplification of intergovernmental relations but because of historical and cultural differences I do not expect anything at all will be gained by harmonizing substantive criminal law.
Unlike Mr Pirker, and Mr RÃ¼big who stood in for him today, we do not want to ask the Austrians, who in any case have been deprived by their government of their favourite toy, "bearer savings books' , in order to combat money laundering, to give up sovereignty in the field of substantive criminal law or redefine the concept of sovereignty.
The demand made in recital K of the report to relinquish dual prosecution and scrap dual punishability indicates a misunderstanding and a misleading confusion of the two terms and a failure to appreciate the principle of the deputizing of the administration of international criminal justice.
To sum up, I do not see any need either to harmonize substantive criminal law or for a state prosecutor with Europe-wide jurisdiction but rather a need for some form of improved cooperation between prosecuting authorities.
