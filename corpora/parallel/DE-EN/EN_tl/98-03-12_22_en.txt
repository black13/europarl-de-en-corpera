Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although the idea of a transnational European Volunteer Service is to be welcomed - and I should like to express to the rapporteur my appreciation of all the work she has done -, I fear that the objective set out in the report will not be achieved due to a lack of funds.
I am now in the strange position of having written down several more points which all the previous speakers have already dealt with.
Everyone has been so unanimous on these points that I should perhaps concentrate on points that have not yet been addressed, as it is seldom that there is such unanimity in this House and such a positive attitude.
The only proposal that we could add is that a system which can be verified objectively should be worked out to define selection criteria which will ensure that each young person has the same chance in all the applications in the various countries, regardless of the country they apply in.
It should not be the case that preference is given to young people who already work in existing organizations and have been prepared for the selection criteria.
To sum up, I should like to point out that - if we are to take the words of the American President seriously - America is preparing for a training explosion.
In other words, if these programmes proposed here are not given adequate financial support, in ten years' time we shall be lagging a long way behind the USA.
We therefore support this proposal and appeal to everyone to support it along with us.
