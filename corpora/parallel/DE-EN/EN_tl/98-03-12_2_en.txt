Mr President, there was quite a bit of commotion yesterday due to the way your predecessor chaired yesterday's sitting.
I freely admit that even I myself took part in the protests, with the result that I was not able to follow what was happening.
I therefore wanted to tell you that I inadvertently voted "yes' in the vote on the Cornelissen report on the first part of recital 0, when I intended to vote "no' .
Please correct this.
