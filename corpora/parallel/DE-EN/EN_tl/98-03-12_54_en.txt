Mr President, I fully support what Mr Brinkhorst has said.
What we are discussing here is not a trivial matter.
On behalf of all my colleagues who have worked hard on this report and attach great importance to Commissioner Gradin's opinion, I should like to protest against the conditions under which we have to conduct our discussions here.
To my knowledge, this is the third time that Mrs Gradin has spoken in the early afternoon and hardly anyone is listening, while threequarters of Parliament are talking about other things.
I consider this unworthy of a parliament and an insult to the Commission.
