Mr President, I should like to join in this protest.
For one thing, I think it is frustrating to suspend the debate like this, which has happened on a number of occasions in this area.
I appeal to the Bureau and the sittings service to arrange the times better to ensure this does not recur in future.
We are grateful that Mrs Gradin was able to speak, although under pressure of time, and some people were actually listening to her, Mr Schulz, but of course it is bad manners to have all this uproar going on all around while the Commissioner is speaking.
This must be prevented from happening in future, not just to you, Mrs Gradin, but in general.
It will not do, the way we are conducting this!
Furthermore, I am sorry that the debate has been suspended as many colleagues will quite possibly not be present this evening if there is further discussion.
All in all, this is a really unsatisfactory situation which must be remedied.
It should not happen again!
Mr President, I would also like to draw your attention to the fact that on my list the report is shown as ready to be voted on.
This will just not do!
I am sorry that the vote will take place who knows when and this debate will be suspended again as well, so that we will not be able to make a connection between the report, the debate, the Commission's opinion and finally the vote.
I would therefore like to join this protest.
