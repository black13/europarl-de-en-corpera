Mr President, it is quite noticeable that the people who are now shouting "no' so loudly were the same people who were not listening to Mrs Gradin when she entered the Chamber.
But that is normal in this House.
It is fortunate, Mr President, that some of this heckling is impossible to translate, otherwise the Minutes would show that there are people here who were very badly brought up.
I definitely share your opinion.
Pursuant to the Rules of Procedure, if the motion has yet to be tabled it can still be tabled before the vote.
However, I think we would be much further forward if the accompanying circumstances rightly criticized by Mr Brinkhorst had not happened in the first place.
The Bontempi report is an important report.
We have heard the Commission's opinion.
I believe that after months of consultation in committee it is now time that we adopt it.
This should be done tomorrow as the vote is scheduled for tomorrow.
All the Members who are so happy about it should be here tomorrow at noon to join in the vote.
(Applause)
