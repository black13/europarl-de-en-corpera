Mr President, before the vote I found a list at my seat.
This list contained the name and seat number of all the members who attended yesterday's sitting.
Could you please inform me in the course of today or tomorrow who made this list, what it is meant to be for and why I found it at my seat while none of the other members of my group had possession of this list?
