Mr President, I should like to make two very brief oral statements.
The first one relates to Mrs Fontaine's report.
The voluntary service will only be acceptable to Europe's young people if significant financial resources are made available.
In this context, "significant' means at least enough money to allow young people from all fifteen Member States and, hopefully, in the near future, the associated countries as well, to take part in the programme.
ECU 35 million would enable, at the most, five thousand young people to do so.
That is too little.
The minimum is ECU 80 million to take account of the ECU 25 million set aside from the 1998 financial year, so that ECU 55 million will be left for 1999.
I therefore appeal to the Council and in particular to the German Minister for Youth, Mrs Nolte, to speak out strongly in the Council in favour of the sum called for by Parliament.
The room for manoeuvre in Article 3 allows for this increase.
Lack of funds cannot therefore be given as a reason for rejecting this call.
