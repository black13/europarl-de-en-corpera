Mr President, I have now been able to vote for this compromise resolution as it has been considerably improved by the Liberal motions.
In fact, I think we are about to be hypocritical as the measures proposed by the contact group and others could have been applied over the past few years - I have brought up this subject here on many occasions - to prevent outbreaks of violence.
By doing nothing we share some of the guilt for the fact that this outbreak of violence has taken place.
We did not even manage to open an EU office in Kosovo and now we want to take the political measures that should have been taken at that time.
This must be pointed out, yet it is once more a case of too little, too late.
The idea of autonomy has probably gone down in a hail of bullets in the past few days, and we have only one more opportunity, namely the deployment of international observers and troops, to ensure that Kosovo gains autonomy under international supervision and can decide its own future in dialogue with Belgrade after a few years of peace.
