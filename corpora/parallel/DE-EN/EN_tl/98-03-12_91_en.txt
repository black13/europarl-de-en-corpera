Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking you for your kind words and for the way in which you are chairing this sitting.
On the subject itself, I would like to say that it is of the greatest importance to set up a criminal court of this kind and to introduce appropriate measures within the framework of the United Nations.
I applaud the fact that the city of Nuremberg has applied to be the location for this court; being fully aware of its tragic history when it was mistreated by one of the greatest criminals in human history, Adolf Hitler, it is putting itself in a position to make a contribution towards the restitution of morality.
I congratulate Nuremberg for taking the initiative to apply to be the location for such an institution.
