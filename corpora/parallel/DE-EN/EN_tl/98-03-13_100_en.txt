Mr President, I wanted to speak on the same point, and I my point is this: for over eighteen years - since the first European election - evening sessions and Friday sessions were reported by our information services in the same way as all other sessions.
For some time now, reporting has been systematically cut back.
It would be good to report on precisely the occasions when fewer reporters tend to be present, and for our information services to take appropriate action to compensate for this.
We should attach the greatest value to the absolute principle of equal status for all debates in this House, whenever they take place.
