Mr President, I would like to bring your attention to another problem on a point of order.
I did not ask to speak this morning when the minutes were approved, because yesterday's session seemed to me to be correctly recorded.
We voted yesterday on the Fontaine report, by roll-call vote en bloc on ten proposals from the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights.
The minutes correctly mention multiple roll-call votes.
Since then, I have had the opportunity to see the results of the roll-call votes, where this block of ten is listed as a single roll-call vote.
Given the decisions of the Conference of Presidents, in my opinion there is a need to clarify whether the vote yesterday counts as ten roll-call votes or one.
In my opinion, the former is the case.
