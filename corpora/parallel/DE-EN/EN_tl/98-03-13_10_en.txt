Madam President, yesterday afternoon and this morning we had a large number of roll-call votes.
There is a new ruling by the Bureau according to which only the roll-call votes up to Thursday noon are counted.
May I assume that the Members who took part in the roll-call votes yesterday afternoon and this morning will get a credit for this?
