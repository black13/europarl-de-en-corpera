Madam President, I would like to talk about the Teverson report.
Anyone who looks at the Commission's report can only agree with the rapporteur.
We ought to be extremely worried that since the first report was published a year ago there has been no improvement in controls, and that the political will of the Member States is evidently lacking.
But it is also regrettable that the Commission's report is so feeble and meaningless.
It almost gives the impression that the Commission just wants to relieve itself of a burdensome duty.
It is too passive and too hesitant, whereas definite action is what is needed.
For instance, the Commission absolutely must give the Member States clearer rules about what kind of information they are to provide, so as to obtain uniform information, because comparable information can only be obtained if this is done.
Otherwise, the end result will be a report which begs more questions than it answers.
An action plan for improving controls by the Member States is also necessary, covering all sectors of the Common Fisheries Policy, including marketing channels, for instance.
An essential goal of this action plan should be to encourage cooperation between Member States, but also between them and the Commission.
However, the Commission will not be able to avoid giving serious consideration to harmonizing sanctions, because only deterrence provides protection against infringement, and only uniformity of sanctions can help to make the monitoring activities credible to the fishermen of the various Member States.
Credibility is also the key word of my last comment.
I would particularly like to highlight one sentence in Mr Teverson's report: ' The Commission's annual report about control of the Common Fisheries Policy should contribute essentially to maintaining its credibility.'
I fear that this Commission report has not quite lived up to this.
