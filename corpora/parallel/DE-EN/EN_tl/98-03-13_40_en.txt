Madam President, I rise to speak about the Teverson report, which is one of the most depressing I have ever read.
Anyone who, like me, remembers being told that the sea is our future, that it is a source of unlimited food, that everything is available to us, and who now, just a few years later, reads what Mr Teverson has said, will see a tragic picture emerging.
On the other hand, there are still many reasons for being optimistic, not least because of the fact that we have an excellent Fisheries Commissioner, who has energetically achieved a great deal.
But it is also true that we are still dependent on national governments today, and they have no will at all.
They are much too weak, whether policy or security is at stake.
If our governments are weak, then Europe is weak, and that lies at the heart of the tragic part which our continent has to play in this whole field, quite apart from the fact that we only ever talk about Europeans.
The real criminals of the sea are the Russians, the Americans and the Japanese, with their big industries which actually exterminate whole regions.
We only have to look at the coast of South America and see what is happening there.
I believe that the Teverson report is a signal to us to call on our governments again to stir themselves into action at last, because otherwise they will yet sink Europe.
