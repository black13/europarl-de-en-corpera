Madam President, Madam Commissioner, multiannual guidance programmes I, II and III from 1983 to the end of 1996 did not succeed in eliminating the mismatch between the over-sized fishing fleets of the European Union and the critical state of its fish stocks.
There are various reasons for this.
On the one hand, according to the rapporteur, there were different measurement bases in the Member States when the multiannual guidance programmes were introduced, and on the other, there was the lenient way Member States implemented the rules.
It is obvious that there were very big differences in implementation by Member States.
Despite the Commission's good intentions - and I hold the Member States equally responsible - there is still a lot of catching up to do in implementing the rules.
It is good that there was progress between 1992 and 1996.
A reduction in the tonnage and engine power of the EU fishing fleet was achieved.
But this has changed little as far as the critical state of the fish stocks is concerned.
It is therefore doubtful whether MGP IV will result in any fundamental improvement.
This has already been demonstrated by the resistance of some Member States to the provisional rules under MGP IV.
The rules which were then finally decided are also only half-hearted in my opinion.
If MGP IV is to yield the successful outcome we are seeking - and here I agree with the rapporteur - the Commission must use effective instruments which are not dependent on the Member States' good will.
I would like to add one important point: the socio-economic effects not only on fishermen themselves, but also on the whole coastal region.
I foresee the greatest difficulties for Member States here, and I hope that fisheries will be discussed in the structural fund debates, and not just at the margin.
