Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, whenever we in this House simultaneously talk about the Europe of free movement and the Europe of diversity, it is rather like trying to square the circle.
At the very least it is an extremely difficult conundrum to solve, and the solution varies from case to case.
Achieving these two ideals may simply involve the Europe of the internal market, the Europe of unity, taking the highest cultural achievement, the highest cultural and social state of development of one country as the basis for the common law.
Then the wealth of Europe would become the common wealth.
The task of reconciling these ideals becomes insoluble if it is misused for deregulation, as is the case here.
Nothing has been said about the situation of architecture.
The demands of the Committee for Culture, Youth, Education and the Media have been ignored.
It is not a question of training and badly equipped universities, what is at stake is whether we recognize architecture as art, culture and science, or whether we yield to the exploitative pressures of the building and real estate sectors.
I therefore ask this House to accept the very carefully worked out compromise proposal from our Italian colleagues, because it at least preserves something of the cultural and social ideals of architecture.
