Mr President, the directive on mutual recognition of diplomas in architecture is one of the series of regulations essential for completing the common European market.
The right of establishment and freedom to provide services are a fundamental requirement for a common market, which obviously can only be achieved if the professional qualifications which are gained in one Member State are recognized in the other.
Through my work in the Committee on Petitions, I repeatedly see petitions from EU citizens demanding recognition of their qualifications.
I speak here as a member of the Committee on Culture, and we really have considered this very thoroughly.
It is clear to us all that it will require a great effort on our part if we are to create regulations for mutual recognition of diplomas.
However, in all our efforts it is important that we do not lose sight of the cultural independence of the individual Member States, and remember that regulations about mutual recognition of diplomas must not lead to uniformity of educational content.
For instance, in Germany there is, as well as the classical study of architecture, which is pursued at universities, study at 'higher colleges of technology' .
In spite of the shorter duration of study, there is no question of the graduates being less qualified.
In the design of the course, great value is explicitly attached to efficiency and a high level of practicality, and also to cultural aspects.
The diversity of European culture should be maintained by preserving the cultural sovereignty of the Member States.
This also involves ensuring the diversity of educational systems in the EU states.
We must concentrate above all on achieving comparability of our educational systems.
If we succeed in achieving this ideal, we will arrive at more useful arrangements for mutual recognition of diplomas, and thus advance along the path to European unity.
(Applause)
