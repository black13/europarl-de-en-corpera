Mr President, I must honestly say that it is obviously Mr Ford's problem whether he takes it seriously or not.
It is a fact that the discussions on Friday morning mostly do not concern the whole European population, but a certain target group.
But they are just as important as any other discussion.
I would therefore like to support emphatically Mr Hallam's conclusion that it is without doubt time to televise these debates too.
It is equally important cover the evening sessions better.
The reports which we receive on the evening sessions are not equivalent to the reports which we receive about the normal day sessions.
That is also unacceptable.
I urge you, because I know that you take Friday and all the night sessions very seriously, to take the initiative in the Conference of Presidents, and to ensure that these are treated equally.
