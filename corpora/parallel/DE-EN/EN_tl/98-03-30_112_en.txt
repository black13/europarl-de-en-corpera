Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I can express my ardent support but briefly here, although I have to say that it is tinged with considerable annoyance.
For here realism really does change to minimalism.
It is clear that students, refugees, unemployed pensioners and those about to retire should be included in the scheme.
It is clear too that civil servants, third country nationals and the self-employed who do not have large amounts of capital behind them should also be included.
Yet, Commissioner, what has to happen before the Council finally looks for a solution to these problems?
It is not as if we were discussing this issue for the first time.
The single market, ladies and gentlemen, is in a bad way right on the eve of the euro.
I do not know if you have ever had a puppy that has gone romping through the fields - on four legs.
The single market is hobbling badly - and it hurts to watch it - because its fourth leg, the freedom of movement of workers, is lame.
It might not keel over, it can get about on three legs still, but it is painful.
We need to get the single market out of the habit of moving in this way, for it does so at the expense of dependent employment in all its forms.
We have not even begun to address the atypical forms of work that are developing.
And we cannot justify this inaction in a situation in which the single market is being consolidated by the euro.
I believe this is a matter of the utmost urgency, and if something is not done about it soon, then something will certainly happen.
