Madam President, I can only agree with Mr BÃ¶ge.
It is time we had data so that rational discussion might take place and so that we do not have to rely on the data from the associations.
That is why we need rational discussion and a study on the social impact, to which this House must of course be able to give its backing.
Otherwise, I believe, it will not do justice to the situation that will face us in 1999.
