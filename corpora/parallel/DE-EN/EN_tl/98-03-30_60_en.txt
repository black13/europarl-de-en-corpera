Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, tourist activity is business activity.
Beside the economic dimension, however, we should never neglect the human aspect, that is to say the needs and wishes of the people.
If we only talk about consumer rights in this context, then we should not forget to mention that rights also involve duties.
This aspect has been neglected in the motion for the resolution.
In addition, I should also like to express my reservations about the respect shown for the subsidiarity principle in one or two paragraphs.
The large number of proposals leaves you feeling that tourism is something uncertain today, as if neither the Member States nor the EU had really done anything essential or decisive in this area.
That is not the case, however.
The apparent best is also the enemy of the good for us as consumers.
To this extent, I recognize great parallels with the draft directive on consumer goods guarantees.
Now, as then, we need to guard against destroying the balance between egalitarianism, justice and freedom, hence also between the legitimate interests, rights and duties of consumers and business operators.
Employing and emphasizing undeniably positive concepts such as environmental protection, consumer rights and human rights should not lead to blind overregulation, resulting in the hampering of initiatives in the tourism trade too and a risk to the independence of small and medium-sized enterprises!
We will not achieve our strategic objective of increased competition and improved quality through a contrived comprehensive cover approach, but rather through the key concept of 'partnership' .
Let us prove to the Member States that responsibility for tourism at European level does not mean an increase in bureaucracy, but will on the contrary help bring about deregulation and a reduction in bureaucracy.
