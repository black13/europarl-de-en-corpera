Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, tourism has a long tradition in Austria and has become the economic mainstay of many regions.
For this reason I very much welcome the fact that the European Parliament is becoming increasingly interested in it as a topic of concern.
When I say what a considerable influence the tourist trade has on the Austrian economy, then I wish to point out its significance in this regard for the rural region.
The rural region includes much more than its agriculture: its business enterprises, service industries and especially the tourist trade all form a part of it.
Additional sources of income and an improvement in infrastructure are the result, and a depopulation of these rural areas is thereby prevented.
Tourism can boost the fortunes of less developed regions.
However, cross-border regions can also profit from it.
For a long time now, Austria has been having a rethink, particularly in the area of environmental awareness and consideration for the environment.
I think safeguarding natural resources is essential.
I should finally like to state most categorically that we should unite to combat sex tourism.
