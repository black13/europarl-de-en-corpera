Mr President, Commissioner, I would first of all like to thank Mr Megahy for his excellent work, for we do not often find that the Council adopts nearly all Parliament's amendments - at least in spirit.
That is no doubt a sign of the good work that has gone on here.
We can now for our part approve the common position of the Council at second reading and will then, hopefully, have obtained at last the European disabled person's parking card, which has been promised for 20 years.
The Council has agreed in its opinion that the card can be used independently of the vehicle, hence that it is individual and not vehicle-specific, that for security reasons the address should not be recorded on the card and that information on conditions of use should be provided when the card is issued.
The Council is also proposing that the European card be used parallel to the national cards, which makes sense at least for a transitional period.
We shall also be discussing this week the report on the free movement of persons produced by the High-Level Panel.
For disabled people, freedom of movement is basically only a dream.
Reality causes them even greater problems, and there is an even larger number of hurdles for them to overcome than there is for so-called normal people.
Perhaps this European card will provide an opportunity to remove the initial small hurdles.
In my speech in December 1996 at first reading of the report I complained that this card is just eyewash, and I wish to reaffirm this again today.
Because, you see, it is left open to the individual states whether they introduce it or not, and it is only valid according to the particular regulations in the particular country, and these are not in alignment.
Nevertheless, the card is a first step in the right direction, and I hope it will be a benefit for everyone.
