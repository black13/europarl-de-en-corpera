Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, only a few days ago I held a conference on the subject 'So disabled people might have a place in our midst' .
It was interesting to see the great significance that was attached to the aspect of real discrimination against disabled people travelling inside the EU as a result of the non-availability of a European parking card.
The issue of increased mobility through constantly improving technical provisions, on the one hand, and a certain confusion as to the rights and duties of participating in road traffic in the EU, on the other, soon became the focal point of the discussions.
At the same time, those affected expressed their concern over too much regulation, as well as their fears as to whether their hopes and desires, which I convey as their man in Brussels, are being noticed and heard at all.
I recommend that the common position now on the table be given our unqualified acceptance.
The Parliamentary amendments I consider important from first reading have been adopted either word for word or in spirit.
Of particular importance in my view are: firstly, the decision in favour of an individual-based as opposed to a vehicle-based solution; secondly, the special attention paid to security aspects in protecting the holder's personal data; and, thirdly, that our demands for subsidiarity, public accessibility and transparency represent a real basis in that, on the one hand, the community model can be used to supplement regionally or nationally valid cards already existing while, on the other hand, the issuing of this new model card is coupled with a duty to provide information about its conditions of use in the individual Member States.
Unfortunately, the recommendation fails to harmonize access conditions for such a parking card.
Also, and precisely because I come from a city which is to be the 1999 European City of Culture, namely Weimar, I recommend that Member States implement this recommendation quickly so that a place in our midst can really be made accessible to disabled people soon.
