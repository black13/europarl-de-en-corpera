Mr President, advertising is dominated by the big companies and multilateral corporations.
Their presence in this sector establishes them firmly in the minds of the people.
Just think of Coca-Cola, for example.
Every child, no matter where, knows the name.
However, the real mainstay of our economy is not the handful of big businesses but rather the many small ones, the SMEs.
These account for 66 % of total employment in the EU and are marked by a strong gross employment growth.
I therefore welcome any initiative which enables us to provide financial assistance to these highly efficient businesses, for one of the biggest problems facing small entrepreneurs is the generally poor availability of own capital.
Only by subsequent assessment will it be possible to establish whether or not the aim of the programme, namely to create more jobs, has actually been achieved.
The earlier we carry out this assessment, and the greater the detail of our reporting, then the greater will be the success of the programmes and the effectiveness of the financial resources used.
I therefore fully support the adoption of Amendment No 10.
