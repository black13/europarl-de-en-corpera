Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if my memory serves me well, social justice is the central concept of the Christian doctrine.
I believe that Plato was absolutely right when he said that one cannot build a community without justice.
We are now living in a state of globalization and the world is now a global community, even though we may not always be as mindful of this as we should be.
To stand up and say that the world market will take care of this, that the technological development and deregulation actually taking place will somehow solve the problems, is simply unchristian, and what is more it is foolish.
I am therefore simply astonished that those on the Right of this House are saying: no, we cannot do that under any circumstances, particularly since I would like to remind you that even in the run-up to Copenhagen this Parliament agreed by majority vote to do and to call for this very thing.
What matters is whether we succeed in actually using the process of the UN Summit to reverse the trend of blind globalization and ideological globalism, and whether we succeed in steering towards social justice, ecological sustainability and democratic co-determination, even for those living in the poorer countries.
The Copenhagen commitments must be realized.
The Commission has played a very positive role here, though Mrs Sch√∂rling has indicated, and quite rightly in my opinion, that there is still work to be done here.
In this respect, we would like to support the Commission, in full recognition of the work which it is doing, but also with the intention of promoting and accelerating this work, for the decision which is at stake will affect the future of the planet.
