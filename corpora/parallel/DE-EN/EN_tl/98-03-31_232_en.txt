Mr Commissioner, thank you for your detailed answer.
I should just like to put two short questions to you.
You spoke primarily of working women.
I just wanted to ask if there were any studies or programmes - though particularly studies - which relate to the financial support of women or men, though it will mainly be the women who decide to devote themselves to raising children?
My second question is this: are there any studies or programmes which deal with the provision of old-age pensions for this particular group?
