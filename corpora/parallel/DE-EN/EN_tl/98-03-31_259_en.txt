Mr President, we realize that these subsidies are necessary to create a level playing field on the world market.
They can, however, only be accepted if such aid is also transparent.
For this purpose the Commission must, in our view, procure its own right of verification.
It can be seen that there is worldwide over-capacity in the shipbuilding industry and it would therefore be absurd to further subsidise these existing capacities.
It would be much more sensible to subsidise innovative projects in this field, to give more intensive support to research and development and in this way to create an opportunity for genuine future markets in shipbuilding.
I should like to give an example from a very poor region in Sachsen-Anhalt, where a small shipyard, Roszlau on Elbe, had no chance of further contracts.
It initiated a crucial innovation, namely the building of flat-bottomed boats, which do not require rivers to be widened for their use.
The environment creates jobs - that is all I can say - and in this case it succeeded!
We are talking about a new market which is urgently needed throughout Europe, which needs to be provided for, which will also be of global interest and which, at the same time, can secure jobs which had already been written off.
