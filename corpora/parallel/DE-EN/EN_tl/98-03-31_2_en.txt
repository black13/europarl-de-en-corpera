Madam President, page 6 of the Minutes clearly contains an error.
What has been recorded is that Mr RÃ¼big asked the President a question about crime in Brussels and about whether this subject has been referred to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities.
He received the answer that this problem was being taken seriously and that the authorities in Brussels had been informed of it.
But the Brussels' authorities are not the Committee on the Rules of Procedure.
I merely wanted to ask whether the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities was dealing with the matter as a question of urgency.
