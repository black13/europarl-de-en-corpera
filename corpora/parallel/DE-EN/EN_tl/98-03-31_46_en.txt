Yes, I would just like to explain that.
I have the German text and in this version the term "public prosecutor' carries a certain meaning.
There is nothing comparable at European level.
This term is represented differently in each language.
I have had approaches made from so many sides that I have resorted to the German text as it was submitted in committee.
I am not responsible for the translation.
Clearly, something has been created here which does not yet exist, which takes account of national circumstances, usage and traditions and indeed powers of authority.
What we should really call it ultimately becomes the second question.
I would therefore ask you not to attribute a particular meaning to this word as such, but rather to identify the underlying concept.
I hope that Mrs Gradin will have the opportunity today to comment on this matter, for we are not seeking to interfere in national arrangements but rather are contemplating the setting-up of a new European institution.
Mr President, I should also like to draw your attention to another matter.
I am speaking on a point of order.
I do not know what the list of speakers looks like, but if for a third time we find that Mrs Gradin has to voice her opinion and that of the Commission while Members of this House are pouring into the Chamber, with all the noise that this entails, and with the vote soon to take place, then I say that this is simply unacceptable.
I would therefore ask that you organize the sitting in such a way that Mrs Gradin has the full attention of this House and is not disturbed by noise of any kind.
I hope that you will give this matter your attention.
