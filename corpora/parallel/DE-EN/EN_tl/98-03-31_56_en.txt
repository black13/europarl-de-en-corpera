Mr President, this report leads me to think that the status quo in the fight against multinational fraud is unsatisfactory.
As I have repeated on a number of occasions, I support any improvement in cooperation between the national prosecution authorities and, naturally, I also support the optimal use of existing databases.
There is no doubt that developing UCLAF into an independent coordination and information body would be a real contribution to the fight against international crime.
But of course we need a clear definition of the role and responsibilities of this special body, and we also need to know what provisions are to be made to protect its independence.
In other respects, of course, neither the principle of an alternate international criminal justice system nor the principle of ne bis in idem stand in the way of an efficient prosecution of transnational fraud; the real problem here is the absence of an effective intergovernmental legal procedure, and this has to be put right.
We reject the idea of a public prosecutor with European-wide jurisdiction in the same way as we reject the Europeanization of criminal law.
For this reason we cannot accept any report which would lead us in this direction.
