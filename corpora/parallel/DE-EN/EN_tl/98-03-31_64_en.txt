Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that it is a scandal of the highest order, and one which has been running for years, that the problems caused by an incomplete system of regulations and a lack of harmonization, which frontier workers have to endure on a personal basis, have still not ben solved.
We in this Parliament are responsible for doing everything we can to bring maximum pressure to bear on the Council and the Commission, whose efforts in this area I fully acknowledge.
We can do this by agreeing to the proposal put forward by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, even though the UK Presidency may be somewhat annoyed about it.
What we are trying to do here is to represent the interests of a large number of people, and not those of a Presidency which is hoping for less discord in the ranks.
