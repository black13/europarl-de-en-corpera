Mr President, in our amendment my group has called for the setting up of a Mr or Mrs Reconstruction for Bosnia and Herzegovina.
In discussions with the other groups and with the Commission we have reached general consensus that if we withdraw the word Mr or Mrs Reconstruction, then the amendment will be approved, the reason being that it will be moving towards replacing this function with a Mr or Mrs Director-General appointed by the Commission.
We should not burden this initiative with terms which leave us in the dark as to who is involved.
I would therefore ask the House to vote on this amendment without including a 'Mr or Mrs Reconstruction' .
