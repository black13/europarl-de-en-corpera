Ladies and gentlemen, we have just discussed this problem a short while ago.
I started out from the German version, which was the one also voted on in committee.
The fact that there is no European judicial, prosecuting or investigating authority, nor is there a public prosecutor, makes it very difficult indeed to find a common term which does justice to all the different national systems.
The term 'public prosecutor' was proposed in a study, but it is not an established term as such.
As I encountered a great deal of resistance to the German term for public prosecutor, which is 'Staatsanwaltschaft' , I have tried to find a more neutral expression for my report and then to have this put to the vote.
It was of course not the different translated versions which were voted on.
Since approaches were later made to me that the translation was inexact, and even misleading, I requested that the term be changed to comply with German translation, which is what I started off with.
However, I should like to point out again that what we have to define here is something which does not yet exist.
Some time ago I even asked the Commission for a definition.
The term must be so filled with meaning that the jurisdiction of the Member States is fully taken into account and left intact.
For me, the problem therefore centred around the translated version.
I was slightly amazed that approaches were made to me on this subject late last night.
Yet I would earnestly request that you examine the general content rather than focusing on a word for which we have still to find a definition, which is what I have requested.
