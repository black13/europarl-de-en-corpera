Mr President, the various groups, including of course my own, have been discussing the report as it was then, namely without the corrigendum, and have formed an opinion on it.
I therefore believe that we can only vote on the text as we knew it at the time.
I would like to ask Mrs Theato to withdraw the corrigendum, since instead of clarifying the situation it has clearly only served to confuse matters further.
If she does not withdraw it, I will propose on behalf of my group that the report be referred back to committee.
