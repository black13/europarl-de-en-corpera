I should like to thank Mrs Green most sincerely for her contribution which has clearly helped clarify the situation.
I am prepared to withdraw the corrigendum.
I should just like to point out that this in no way concerns me directly.
But I would say that all those Members, wherever they may be, will now be leaving me out on a limb if they vote against the resolution on the basis of the withdrawal of the corrigendum.
I would like to make that absolutely clear.
Let me state quite categorically that the name of this new body, which we are going to set up some day or other, is not the main issue for me.
The most important thing in my view is that we get started, so that the protection of the Union's financial interests is assured.
