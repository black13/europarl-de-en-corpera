Mr President, the vote which you now wish to conduct is inadmissible.
The rapporteur said that the original text was in German.
If we are now to proceed to a vote, then we shall be voting on the work of the translators and not on the issue in question.
I therefore consider the vote you are proposing to be inadmissible.
We should be voting on the basis of the German text.
