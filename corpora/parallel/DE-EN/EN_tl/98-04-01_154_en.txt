Mr President, the full independence of the European Central Bank is quite rightly anchored in the Treaty.
The highest aim of its monetary policy is to ensure price stability.
The decision on how far the European Central Bank supports the general economic policy of the Community thus depends on its assessment of a possible effect on the aim of price stability.
Price stability at any price, even at the price of increasing unemployment!
That is, to come to the point, the public discourse, which in the end means one thing: monetary policy is not neutral.
That is why it is necessary to involve the European Central Bank in a dialogue about politics.
I do not believe that the independence of the European Central Bank on the one hand and the required democratic transparency on the other must necessarily be in contradiction to each other.
But I am certain that monetary union needs the acceptance of citizens to be successful.
This, however, can only be achieved by the transparency of the decisions of the European Central Bank and by their democratic legitimization.
