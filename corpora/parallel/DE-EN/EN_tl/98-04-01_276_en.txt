Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the two reports with which we are dealing today are closely related, and anyone who, like me and others here, has followed events on the ground for years, realizes that without the presence of the SFOR soldiers the civilian peace process has no chance.
I would recommend to Mr Ephremidis that he should go to Sarajevo and its surroundings; he would come back with the same realization.
He could not do otherwise.
But if you do not open your eyes, you do not change direction.
The soldiers prevent open hostilities, they sometimes help to seize war criminals, they support the reconstruction literally with their own hands, for example, by building bridges.
They - at least the Franco-German brigade - are also actively involved in the repatriation of refugees, because they systematically collect data and facts village by village, which are the necessary preconditions for return, and they then pass them on to the appropriate German authorities.
For our financial help to flow and reconstruction really to start, we need an instrument other than the PHARE programme, which, for its implementation on the recipients' side, assumes structures which do not yet exist and will not exist for a long time.
Just imagine that the Marshall Plan had had to function in these circumstances after World War II.
We would still be waiting for its beneficial impact.
Thank heaven, the Commission is prepared to follow up the discoveries of the delegation which was in Bosnia, so that finally the financial aid is reaching its target.
For egoistic national reasons, the Council shared the guilt for the previous mismanagement, but in the main it passed the buck to the Commission.
The Council must finally accept Mr Schwaiger's proposals, for the sake of Europe's credibility.
We need a truly responsible plenipotentiary of Europe on the ground.
Otherwise, we shall lose to the Americans what little is left of our credibility, influence and respect!
