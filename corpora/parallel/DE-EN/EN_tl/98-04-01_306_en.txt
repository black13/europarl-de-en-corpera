Madam President, I would first like to thank Mrs DÃ¼hrkop and Mr Viola sincerely for their reports.
I believe that they are balanced guidelines, and it seems particularly important to me that we should build a so-called bridging budget, which begins to mark out our vision for expansion in the years 2000 to 2006.
I am particularly glad about the setting of priorities, and that the rapporteur has observed the canon of priorities so consistently, to give it special emphasis, and I am obviously in particular glad about the priority for the post-Kyoto process with the new budget for 1999, which allows us to make a decisive contribution.
At this point I would like to announce to the rapporteur some fireworks, good proposals from my party, fireworks which on this occasion do not produce any CO2.
I would like to make, on behalf of my party, proposals which aim at information campaigns to encourage the use of products whose manufacture uses little energy.
I would like to promote restructuring in the research budget, modern energy-saving technologies which lead to a real breakthrough.
I would like the rapporteur to promote pilot projects in the budget, heating insulation for private houses, offices and energy-intensive industries.
And of course, particularly in view of the newcomers in the European Union, I would like to put through a realignment of the SAVE and ALTENER programmes.
Last but not least, a million solar panels, a programme for the acceptance of photo-voltaics.
I believe that if the rapporteur, as she has shown until now, is disposed to 'putting butter on the fish' , and to allowing the priorities to be followed by deeds, a real contribution to the post-Kyoto process can be made in the next budget.
I hope so, and in this spirit I hope for continued good cooperation.
