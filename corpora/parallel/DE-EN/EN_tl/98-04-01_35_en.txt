Mr President, Madam President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first, sincere thanks to both the rapporteurs.
I regret that we cannot address them to Mr Vecchi in person.
At last we have a debate about development cooperation, and we all know that does not happen often.
In the case of the Vecchi report, it is rather a nuisance that it comes practically at the end of the process, and since the Treaty of Amsterdam has not yet been ratified, we have no possibility of ensuring that a series of proposals which have not yet been accepted will be included after all.
Madam President-in-Office, I welcome very much your firm emphasis on the fight against poverty but I would ask you to include as an essential pillar, so to speak, of your deliberations, the question of a health policy with particular reference to the health of mothers and children.
Year after year - we can almost say day after day - for thousands of women in developing countries, pregnancy is equivalent to a death sentence, because there is no way of combatting avoidable risks.
This must not be allowed to happen.
Here in this Parliament, we have a cross-party working party for reproductive health.
So for us this is a special concern.
A further point of which we must certainly be aware is the question of stable currencies.
There is a special passage about it in the Rocard report.
Commissioner, my special plea would be that we ensure with the appropriate structures that increasingly stable and above all convertible currencies are created in the developing countries.
In this connection, I also draw your attention to the question of the CFA zone in the context of European Monetary Union.
A minor error concerning this matter has crept into the report, and I ask the services to correct it.
Paragraph 69 does not fit the context in which it appears.
It ought to be inserted after paragraph 80.
That is its proper place.
This is my final point.
