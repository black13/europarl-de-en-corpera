Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, cooperation by the European Union with the ACP states must be reformed.
There is much that is positive in this cooperation, but there is also much which does not work.
Simply continuing the status quo is certainly not a model for the next millennium.
The present rules are above all discriminatory.
Countries like Bangladesh, Nepal, Bolivia and Nicaragua are excluded, although these are developing countries which need our help just as much as the present ACP states.
I consider that it is rather schizophrenic that in March Parliament adopted an urgent motion on Nicaragua's debt and pointed out the terrible situation of people in Nicaragua, but the accession of Nicaragua to the Lomé Convention was not even seriously discussed.
At its Congress in Toulouse last year, the Group of the European People's Party demanded that future cooperation should no longer be based so much on colonial links, but on income per head and its distribution, and above all on the willingness of those in government to contribute genuinely to the development of people in their country.
I expressly welcome what Mrs Dybkjær said about the expansion of the ACP states and the acceptance of new members.
It would be schizophrenic to restrict the acceptance of new members to Cuba of all countries.
The pre-conditions have not really been fulfilled there.
Commissioner Pinheiro, your mandate for action is a tentative step in the right direction, to make cooperation effective in the future.
Keep at it!
We should support this step and encourage you to take further steps.
Do not be led astray by the protectionists of all countries, but go into the new millennium with a new concept!
