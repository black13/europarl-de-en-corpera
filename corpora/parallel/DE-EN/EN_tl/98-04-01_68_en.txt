Mr President, the sensitive reactions of the West to the risky government restructuring with which the Kremlin leader Yeltsin has startled his European neighbours in the last few days shows once again how profound the links between Western Europe and Russia are.
There is therefore no question about it: the challenge for Europe after the fall of the Wall is the clarification and restructuring of our relationship with Russia.
Basically, the question of European security will depend precisely on the success of the balance struck with Russia.
In the face of that, what the Commission calls an "action plan for the future relationship of the EU and Russia' seems to be a conglomeration of individual measures; it seems aimless, inadequate and unprofessional.
It is another demonstration of the poverty of our common foreign policy that in respect of what is our continent's key concern, neither a decent joint strategy nor a comprehensive set of ideas can be found in it.
I think I have made it clear: For the Green Group, there is no doubt that Russia can also become a member of the Union if it wants to.
Anyone who does not accept this not only ignores the EU Treaty on this point, but also rejects involvement in this great restructuring task of Europe.
Such a rejection is marked by the same spirit as the provocation which was caused by the expansion of military power systems during the Cold War.
It does not contribute to the settlement, peace and stability of this continent.
We need an investment in the partnership process with Russia, and that means an investment in the peace of Europe.
