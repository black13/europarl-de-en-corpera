Mr President, allow me to deal particularly with the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement in this debate.
In this agreement, there is already an effective instrument for carrying on a permanent dialogue with our Russian partners about all those questions of a political and economic nature which are central to our mutual relationship.
Let us not forget that it was the parliaments - the European Parliament and the Russian State Duma - which christened the first of the executive bodies of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, the Parliamentary Cooperation Committee which I chair with my Russian colleague, Mr Ryshkov.
In this capacity I would like to emphasize particularly how profitable the work in this committee was last December.
I can assure you that we address the individual problems in the relationship between the EU and Russia very openly with our Russian colleagues, and that we are frank about the difficulties.
Continuity of contacts and regular mutual visits, which create mutual trust, are particularly important, even if the contacts on the Russian side are continually changing.
I think that it is not too much to say that the form of cooperation which we are developing is a future model for Russian-European cooperation.
In this way, the relationship with our Russian partners can be constructed and can be further extended without discussing Russia's EU membership.
Neither side needs to discuss that.
In this context, allow me to point out the importance of the TACIS programme.
In her report, Mrs Lalumi√®re calls on the Commission to strengthen support for these projects, and demands that the priorities in TACIS aid for the improvement of daily living conditions should start with setting up the structures necessary for the rule of law.
I would like to underline this very explicitly.
We know that we must improve this TACIS programme, but we also know that preparatory work is essential for our future cooperation between Russia and the European Union.
