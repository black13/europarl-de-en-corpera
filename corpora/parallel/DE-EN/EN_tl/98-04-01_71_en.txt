Mr President, first I would like to congratulate Mrs Lalumière on her brilliance, because she reminded me of a colleague I once had, Mr Vergès, who was one of the best lawyers in the world, and to whom I once said: If I am ever found with a bloody knife next to a corpse, I would certainly take him as my advocate.
Mrs Lalumière, if that happens to me again, I would willingly engage you as my lawyer, because we must remember one thing, which was not mentioned here in the discussion, and my colleague Mr González Carnero has underlined it, that we must let caution rule in our relationship with Russia.
I would like to point out the following above all else here: Russia is today, in an era of worldwide decolonization, the last great colonial empire on earth.
The Chechen war showed that clearly, and there will be more colonial wars.
At any rate, I do not want any of my 18 grandchildren to die in a colonial war for the defence of Russia.
We do not need Russia in the European Union before decolonization has taken place, afterwards yes, but not before.
But I would like to point out the other fact, that Mr Yeltsin's last press conference has shown us how dangerous it is to leave the keys to nuclear weapons in such hands.
We must all be clear about that, and therefore we must think more about our security.
Obviously we do not want a war or conflict with Russia, but we must see the situation quite clearly.
I therefore have certain reservations about an over-optimistic representation of a situation which must simply be seen as it is.
The danger is still before us.
