Mr President, I too would like to begin by congratulating Mrs Lalumi√®re on her difficult report.
Although I have submitted a series of amendments, I know that we fundamentally agree.
A few days ago, the Russian human rights activist and Duma member Kovaliev expressed his concern about the anti-democratic tendencies which still exist in his country.
He is a man who loves his country, and anyone who reads his book 'The Flight of the White Raven' will see why he was in prison for seven years.
However, I would like to point out something which has hardly been mentioned.
He accuses both the old and the new leading elites of contempt for democracy and law.
These principles are conditions for the creation of a greater Europe, in which peace, freedom, the rule of law and democracy rule.
The European Union must take note of these questions.
It faces great challenges, because these relationships will have far-reaching consequences on the negotiations which have just begun with all countries.
Russia has joined the Council of Europe, to which all the Member States of the European Union belong.
It has thus said "yes' to the rule of law, democracy and human rights.
It has also said "yes' to the legal community which has been developing up for decades.
We in the European Parliament will approve the relationship with Russia, we want close cooperation, but we shall also pay close attention to, and when necessary issue a reminder about, the reform process in Russia towards a state which operates under the rule of law, respects human rights and establishes a civil society which acts democratically.
