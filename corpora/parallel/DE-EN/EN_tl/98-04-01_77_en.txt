Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me, in the discussion about this report, to say something about the developments in our cooperation within the delegation or within the joint committee which we have with the Russian State Duma and the Federal Council.
When I consider the development in the last few years, I detect that there has been a basic improvement.
Whereas in the joint sessions in the initial phase after 1994 we very often indulged in reciprocal statements - whereby the Russian side was sometimes quite emphatic in forcing us onto certain subjects, for example NATO membership of some east European states, subjects which really had nothing to do with the bilateral relationship between the European Union and Russia and prevented a rational dialogue - this has essentially changed.
It is now the case that we discuss many subjects of mutual interest and thus achieve agreement on many points, or can at least have an effective exchange of experience.
Take, for instance, the debate about TACIS, about the development of the partnership agreement, about Russian or European internal questions, such as the development of international crime, the rule of law or the tax system in Russia.
I believe that it is the task of the European Union to encourage the development towards a stable democracy in Russia, but to observe and follow it critically.
Russia is not yet a stable democracy, because there is still no stable combination there of the elements necessary for it.
The clashes and movements in internal politics make this clear, as we have seen recently.
Nevertheless I believe that Russia is on the right path, and we as Europeans should accompany her and be vigilant.
