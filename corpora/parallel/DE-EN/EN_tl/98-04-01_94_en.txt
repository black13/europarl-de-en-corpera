Madam President, today I do not want to ask for signatures against criminality in Brussels, although we have only until Friday to do so, but I would like to propose, in accordance with Article 129, that the Murphy report should be referred back to the responsible committee, since there are over 100 amendments, which are mainly of a purely technical nature, and to make a SLIM initiative myself.
Two additional directives about measurements, dimensions and technical features of buses are added.
We should therefore agree in a working party on how we intend to proceed with these three directives, in accordance with the rules.
