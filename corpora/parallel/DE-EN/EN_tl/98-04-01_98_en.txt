Madam President, I would like to reply to that personally.
As chairman of the committee, I asked the rapporteur to proceed, as I said, by proposing an amendment about the disabled, but to refer the rest of all of it to the technical bodies.
It was then shown that there were difficulties in doing this.
I therefore proposed setting up a working party to look for a sensible solution.
I proposed this before the vote in the committee.
We then voted on it, but the majority party in this House voted otherwise.
The result was that the Murphy report, which in my opinion was not ready for discussion, came to the House against my will as committee chairman.
I am therefore not now speaking as the committee chairman, but as a member of the Group of the European People's Party.
That is my answer to what Mr Metten has said.
(Applause and heckling)
