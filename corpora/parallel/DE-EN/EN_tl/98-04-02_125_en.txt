Mr President, anyone acquainted with Cameroon - as I am - has a great liking for the country.
Its people are particularly friendly and reasonable, and generally it is still a relatively well-managed country, compared to its neighbours.
It is therefore all the more regrettable when events take place there which absolutely contradict our principles.
However, I would like to point out something else.
We have the Lom√© Convention with these countries, and Article 5 is clear and unambiguous.
But what happens?
To be honest, I have always had the impression that this Article existed on paper only and is not implemented.
If we do not draw the consequences of what we are demanding, we must not be surprised if the governments and people revert to a tradition which is not so very old.
After all, people alive today remember when things were still quite different.
If we do not insist on the implementation of our provisions then it is not surprising.
However, it should make us examine our consciences.
Are the attitudes we support credible?
Is our support of human rights and international law credible?
Are we really credible, and do we use the great opportunities we have to enforce them, not only in a moral sphere, but also in an economic and social sphere, as we always trumpet?
I think we should take up the case of a friendly country such as Cameroon, not in order to criticize it but in order to criticize ourselves, so that we can finally achieve credibility.
