Mr President, of course I emphatically support the release of Mr Njawé and Mr Moussala.
I also think we must attach more importance to the question of press freedom, including in the Lomé states which are closely associated with us.
However, I think we must view the problem in a wider context.
I am very pleased that Article 5 of the Lomé Convention is emphasized so strongly in the resolution.
I think that the freedom of the press is endangered from time to time in the majority of Lomé states, and that it is true that Cameroon is the one-eyed king in the country of the blind.
If we look around the region and consider Nigeria or the Congo, for example, the circumstances are quite different.
I am therefore of the opinion that Cameroon is one of the states characterized by relative stability, which also affects the rule of law.
Nevertheless, this event cannot be excused.
We should draw conclusions for our policy as a whole.
As Mr Pinheiro, one of our best commissioners by far, is here today, I would like to take this opportunity to appeal to the Commission and also the Member States to use our development aid much more than in the past, to promote programmes in the fields of education and training which underpin the rule of law.
Educating junior political leadership, public sector officials, judges and all those connected with the media, including journalists of course, is necessary, because freedom of expression is threatened from various sides.
I therefore think we have a very great duty in the field of education and training, to educate junior leaders who will break out of the vicious circle and ensure that a policy is pursued in most of the Lomé states which complies with Article 5 of the Lomé Convention.
We have a very great task here, which we must finally face up to.
