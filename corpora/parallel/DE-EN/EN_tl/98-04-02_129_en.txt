Mr President, I think Mr Posselt is both right and wrong.
We do indeed have a great task here.
However, we have to carry out this task not as if we were masters of the universe, but as people of solidarity who are not trying to teach the Africans how it should be done.
If we consider the history of the 20th century in Europe or the history of European involvement in Africa over the last 300 years, it becomes clear that we are not in a position to rebuke anyone.
We have a common task of basic solidarity.
Cooperation with non-governmental organizations and democratically elected governments are at the forefront here.
We must work with them to find ways and develop initiatives which no longer make an appeal to civil and human rights seem an empty gesture.
