Mr President, a great deal has already been said.
Once again, we have a new case of the death penalty.
This time it is the Mumia Abu-Jamal case, and this time it is in the State of Florida.
What has repeatedly motivated us as Europeans and the European Parliament in these matters is firstly the fact that the death penalty still exists at all in the United States, and secondly the circumstances under which it is carried out.
Each case which is judged or sentenced in this way certainly involves its own tragedy and its own drama.
During the meeting in Geneva recently of the UN Commission on Human Rights, we had the opportunity to speak to a Texan attorney who opposed the death penalty.
He drew attention again to one particular factor which I think we do not appreciate.
First of all, most people in the United States know very little about why and how the death sentence is pronounced.
They do not hear about it and are not even particularly interested.
They usually only ever hear of the dramatic cases.
Also, the nature of the sentencing differs widely from one state to another.
Stepping across a state boundary is practically enough to avoid being sentenced to death for the same crime.
This difference in the severity of the penalty is something which concerns us in all cases, most particularly if it involves the ultimate penalty, the death penalty.
There is no uniform case law on this subject.
The same deed is assessed in different ways.
Sometimes it might be a mass murderer, sometimes a first-time murderer.
Murder is murder and is always dreadful.
But I think we should make it clearer to the Americans why we are so concerned about the death penalty in the United States.
