Mr President, I would like to comment on one of my favourite subjects - the Conference of Presidents.
As you are one of the few Presidents who always provide information about what is said here in a part-session, I would like to point out that it is strange that the Conference of Presidents decided against placing such an important topic as Kosovo on the agenda, on the grounds of lack of time.
Unfortunately, the majority of the House was not in favour of including the topic either.
Consequently, we have discussed three topics today, have interrupted the sitting for twenty minutes, and a current crisis in central Europe has not been discussed.
I feel we should set our agendas much more efficiently and expertly than the Conference of Presidents has done this time.
Please let us return to the urgent debate in full, so that time is also available for the necessary topics.
