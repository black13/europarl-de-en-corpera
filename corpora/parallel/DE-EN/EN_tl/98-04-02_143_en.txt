Mr President, I wish to apologize, because I wanted to ask the rapporteur, who is unfortunately not present, whether she could repeat the question.
It concerns paragraph 5.
This is a difficult situation for me.
I am chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy and I would have liked to have heard what the rapporteur had to say on this.
I know what was agreed - an oral amendment was agreed with Mrs Randzio-Plath which she wanted to table here - but I do not know the exact wording.
Under the circumstances, I would therefore recommend a separate vote, whereby we are in agreement with the first section to 'must ... be exercised ...' .
I would not vote in favour of the second section from 'and that, as the only directly elected institution at this level, the European Parliament is a particularly appropriate institution to hold the ECB to account' in its current form, but in the form which Mrs Randzio-Plath wished to propose now.
That was the problem.
