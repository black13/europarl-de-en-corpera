Mr President, Mrs Randzio-Plath has informed you of the oral amendment tabled, with which Mr von Wogau is not familiar.
There were colleagues here in the Chamber, unfortunately from your own group, Mr von Wogau, who rose when the President asked whether the oral amendment was approved.
There was a sufficient number of them, which resulted in enough colleagues rejecting the oral amendment.
That is the problem we are faced with.
Otherwise there could have been no doubt.
Mrs Randzio-Plath had expressly submitted the oral amendment to the President in advance because she could not be present today.
I would therefore ask for the vote to be taken again on the existing wording.
It was not we who blocked it, but the colleagues who rose.
Then we shall see who has a majority.
