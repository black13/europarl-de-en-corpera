Mr President, many people in this House know that almost every word counts, particularly in this report.
We had wording which allowed us to assume that a broad majority accepted it.
However, some of our colleagues did not actually know that a situation had arisen in this case, for reasons which Mr Herman has just explained, which cannot really be resolved by the usual application of the Rules of Procedure.
If we now adopt a resolution which does not take account of the oral amendment, we shall be doing something which the majority of the House did not want.
I would propose two solutions, which I think are correct, to get us out of the situation.
If you, Mr President, would ask the question again as to whether the oral amendment is to be allowed, we could ask those Members who rose previously with good reason to remain seated, now they know what it is about.
If we had the opportunity to vote on the oral amendment, we would have the result which the vast majority of this House wants, and the majority would be correct.
Should this not be possible, we must resort to what Mr von Wogau proposed.
However, the first solution would be more correct, in my opinion.
