Mr President, first of all I would like to say that we made great efforts in committee - and I expressly acknowledge Mrs Randzio-Plath's efforts - to help reach an agreement.
We had reached agreement on practically all the points in committee, as Mr Herman said.
It was accepted by almost all the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy.
The fact that the expression '... hold the ECB to account' in paragraph 5 seemed to many members of my group to be too strong remained unresolved.
Then people said: ' We shall reach agreement.'
I must say that I myself took no part in this last discussion, but Mr Herman did.
He says he has now found this word, which is the right one.
However, I have the impression that not everyone in the House understands what this word is.
I must say that I do not have it in writing either.
I would therefore suggest, even if it is not strictly in accordance with the procedure, that we ask Mr Herman again to say quite clearly what the subject of the oral amendment is, as tabled by Mr Friedrich.
I would suggest that we reach some sort of agreement.
I think it is reasonable to expect that we do this.
