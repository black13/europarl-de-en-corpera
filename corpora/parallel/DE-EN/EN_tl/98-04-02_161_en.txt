Mr President, I voted in favour of the report on the European Central Bank, although not until there had been significant corrections by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy.
The attempt to push through amendments to the Treaty concerning the appointment of the ECB presidency by the European Parliament failed.
There will rightly be no vote of no confidence against the president of the European Central Bank, and there will be no 'Banking Committee' as a control body.
We owe our word to the citizens that the independence of the ECB will not be not undermined.
As the future guardian of the currency, it must be able to work without any political interference.
Only then will it earn the same high reputation as the Deutsche Bundesbank has in my country.
It will guarantee that there will be absolutely no waiver in stability and budgetary discipline.
The dialogue between the ECB and the European Parliament must be constructive in respect of objectives, specific decisions and coherence between monetary and economic policy, but also social and employment policy.
We therefore say 'Yes' to an open exchange of opinions, but 'No' to mistrust and abstruse control procedures.
Another piece of good news: today the German Federal Constitutional Court has rejected the petition against the euro.
The path for the introduction of the single European currency is now clear.
