Madam President, I am referring to this Rule of Procedure because I cannot leave Mr Voggenhuber's speech unanswered insofar as it affects me.
I would like to mention three things which affect me personally and also take me aback.
Firstly, I utterly reject the statement that discussion has taken place between a coalition of hardline extremists - to paraphrase Mr Voggenhuber.
I described what was said to me about Mr Posselt by summarizing it, saying he was a hardline right- winger.
This was a quotation and not my own choice of words.
Let that be made clear.
Secondly, I announced the support of the Group of the Party of European Socialists by stating that Mr Posselt had largely accommodated us.
I shall now say why.
He has made the areas of civil rights, human rights, minority rights, the establishment of the rule of law, the removal of discriminatory provisions and the adoption of increasing EU vested rights the central point of his report.
Let that be stated.
Thirdly, let that be stated because it is the case, and it is possible to be informed - or rather, Members must know, if contributing to this debate - this is a hint to Mr. Voggenhuber -, that the Rules of Procedure do not prohibit them from reading reports before they talk about them!
(Mr Voggenhuber asked for the floor)
