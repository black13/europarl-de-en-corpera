Madam President, I would also like to make use of this Rule of Procedure - and I think more justifiably, having been mentioned by name, which I did not do in my speech, in which I did not name the Member.
However, I will happily grant him the right to do so.
I believe that, had Mr Schulz been listening to me, he would have noticed that precisely the point which he uses was one of my major criticisms, namely that the legal guarantees, the demand for the rule of law and the stability of institutions is not directed at ourselves, as the state of affairs would make necessary, but at the countries of central and eastern Europe, with incredible moral arrogance.
I think I made it clear that the precise criticism is that in this third pillar, the position of the European Court of Justice has not been clarified in cooperation between justice and home affairs, that we have no list of basic rights, no parliamentary and judicial control over this area, and that the moral finger should be pointing at us, before we point it at others.
That is an evident shortcoming of this report.
It is significant that it does not mention it once.
