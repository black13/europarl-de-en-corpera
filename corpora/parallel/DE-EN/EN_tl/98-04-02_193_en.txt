Madam President, I hesitate to try your patience.
However, if I am to be not only addressed personally but attacked twice in a debate, I also have the right to respond to both speakers.
I shall not exaggerate, and thank you for your generosity.
I would just like to say one thing about not reading reports.
I do not know if it is possible to write reports without reading them, but in case it is possible for some Members, may I just quote one passage which was also quoted by Mr Posselt as if it referred to the EU itself.
However, it must be expressly interpreted as a condition of entry for the countries of central and eastern Europe.
Perhaps it is possible to be a hardline right-winger in this Parliament, but people should, I think, at least know their own reports, in order to be able to defend them rather better.
