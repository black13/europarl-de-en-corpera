Mr President, I consider the Convention on mutual assistance in criminal matters between the Member States of the European Union, on which the report is based, to be a suitable instrument for reducing, if not removing, the existing shortcomings in the combating of cross-border crime, allowing for the justifiable criticism and amendments mentioned by the rapporteur.
International telephone tapping, observing the respective internal legal arrangements, must be just as possible as controlled service, the transmission of procedural documents, the audio-visual examination of witnesses and expert witnesses across borders, and the spontaneous exchange of information between prosecuting authorities, on as simple a basis as possible.
These are instruments which have long been available to organized crime, and their extension to prosecuting authorities should reduce the technical lead enjoyed by organized crime.
We therefore agree with the report in full.
