Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Reding has just spoken most comprehensively about her report and I must congratulate her most sincerely.
I believe that what she has said here, and the content of the unanimously adopted amendments, show that this report was not only prepared very well, but also that its content addresses the points in question.
Nevertheless, I would like to state that this report affects us all, although only a few Members are present, because any of us could commit a traffic offence in another country resulting in disqualification from driving in that country, but not in another.
Although this Convention provides for the respective country of residence to decide whether the driver should be disqualified, there are some cases in which we must ensure that no-one is disqualified from driving when they would not have been disqualified at home.
It is fundamentally necessary that we should get round to making uniform regulations at a European level which are applied uniformly, particularly where traffic legislation is concerned.
As Mrs Reding has stated, a step has been taken in the right direction and I hope that others will follow.
Although there are countries in which the alcohol limit for driving is zero and others where it is 80 mg per 100 ml of blood, these differences should be removed, if we want to have a unified Europe.
I would welcome the introduction of real, uniform regulations in Europe, whether for speeding, the alcohol limit or other areas of traffic legislation, so that we had European rules for disqualification from driving, instead of more rules made under bilateral agreements.
