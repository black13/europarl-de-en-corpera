Mr President, in principle we have two methods of achieving road safety objectives.
The first is penalties, which we are discussing today.
I would also like to comment that disqualification from driving is a threat to the livelihood of many people.
We have experienced many suicides following disqualification.
It is really an extreme measure which should therefore be used carefully.
We have a second method, namely using incentives.
We should emphasize training very intensively, particularly on the roads, as lifelong learning.
We should emphasize research to improve the safety of vehicles, their drivers and the roads, and we should emphasize infrastructure, meaning electronic systems, simply to make traffic safer.
I believe that a combination of both methods will ultimately lead to success in Europe.
