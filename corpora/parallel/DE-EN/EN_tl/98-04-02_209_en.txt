Mr President, nobody wants road hogs to endanger life.
The tone of this report is therefore welcome.
However, it seems to us that the implementation of its intentions has not succeeded.
Apart from the legally unusual construction of Article 3 in conjunction with Article 5, the main problem is, in my opinion, that errors occur for a wide variety of reasons in proceedings abroad, particularly in the investigation of the circumstances, and remain unchallenged, again for a wide variety of reasons.
The linking of the place of residence to findings in the decision in the state in which the offence was committed does not appear to permit the accused to exhaust the full potential for defence to which he would be entitled under the laws of his country of residence.
The facility for the Member State to reject enforcement in a case in which rights of defence have been breached does not, in our opinion, constitute sufficient compensation, for practical reasons.
We would prefer proceedings to take place in the respective country of residence.
