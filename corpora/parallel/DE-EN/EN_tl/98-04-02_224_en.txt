Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my committee held a hearing and a report by Mr Garosci is available.
We must make a distinction between the demand for a survey and the abolition of duty-free.
I share Mr Piecyk's opinion that a survey would illuminate the false stories spread by the lobby, as parliamentary democracy is being put under massive pressure by completely unfair means.
There can be no doubt that the coastal regions which are particularly affected will receive specific aid if necessary.
On the other hand, the discussion is really about cancelling the abolition of duty-free decided on in 1991.
The debate is being dominated by Members from countries in which there are high taxes on consumer goods, or which have borders with such states.
It thus involves Member States in which extensive use is made of tax advantages, which is not justified within the sense of the entire population of the European Union.
Weekend speeches emphasize the importance of tax harmonization again and again, but on Monday morning everyone wants their own tax breaks.
That is why, Commissioner, I share your opinion that duty-free sales must be abolished, because it conceals the concept of cheap shopping - frequently quite blatant consumer deception.
Those who say that airports are in danger must be asked whether the ordinary citizen should subsidize business travellers, by continuing to give them the opportunity to shop tax-free?
I do not think so, and there is absolutely no reason to grant special advantages if we want to harmonize certain fiscal regulations within the scope of the euro.
We can, Commissioner, discuss this much better, and you will be in a better position, if you commission a survey of the regional effects and take the wind out of the sails of the entire lobby!
