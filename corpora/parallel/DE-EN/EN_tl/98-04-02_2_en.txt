Mr President, I wish to comment on the Verbatim Report of Proceedings, to which someone has drawn my attention.
I do not usually read my own speeches, but someone read this out to me.
There are two words in it which I would like to have deleted, because they were addressed to another Member and were not part of my speech.
The words are: ' Be quiet' .
Someone annoyed me, and I asked him rather sharply to be quiet.
He really did annoy me.
This was not addressed to Mrs Lalumi√®re, and so must be deleted from the Verbatim Report of Proceedings.
