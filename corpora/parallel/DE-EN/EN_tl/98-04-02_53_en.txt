Mr President, I refer to Rule 96 of the Rules of Procedure and would ask you not to open the debate now.
My reasons are as follows.
We have 6 minutes left before voting begins.
Anyone who regularly spends time in the Chamber knows what will happen here in a few minutes time: a very undisciplined mass of Members will pour in, with no interest in any debate.
They are only interested in the fact that voting is about to begin, and have no interest in the debate.
That is unfortunate for Mr Posselt, the rapporteur, and Mrs Spaak, the draftsman of opinion, and also for those who are still to speak this afternoon.
However, it is our duty to carry out these debates in a reasonably acceptable manner, and that is no longer possible.
Secondly, Mr President, I would ask you to convey the protest of at least the Social Democrat members of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs to the Bureau of the European Parliament.
Every time, we have the extraordinary pleasure of having to debate our reports at a time like this, which I think is inappropriate in view of the importance of the topics.
Perhaps that could be taken into account in future scheduling.
