Mr President, I regret the circumstances which have led Mr Schulz to make his justified comment.
But I think it is completely justified, and I would like to state quite categorically that I wish to protest at the way this part-session is being conducted, both on behalf of my group, and as rapporteur.
I have absolutely no objection if these reports are discussed on Thursday afternoon or Friday morning.
I will certainly be here, and I think that each day and hour of the part-session is as important as any other.
However, I also think there are specific topics which are of interest to a wide public, and the extremely important matter pertaining to the Rules of Procedures which we discussed this morning, which is very important to us internally but is of no public interest, is quite definitely not one of them.
I wish to protest at the absurdity of us debating matters pertaining to Parliament's Rules of Procedure in the morning, at the most effective time for press coverage, and then postponing the important topics which are of public interest until the evening.
