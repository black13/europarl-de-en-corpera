Mr President, we have now taken a vote on this report.
I assume - gentlemen of the Council of Ministers please take note - that the fact that Parliament has just voted in favour of the motion does not mean that transfer of the reserve resources will happen automatically, but we expect that the assurances given by the Council presidency to this House will also be observed in implementing the resolution in the Council of Ministers.
Should that not be the case, the resources will remain in the reserve fund, to make it clear to those who must pass a resolution on this in the Council that this opinion is not just one for the wastepaper bin, but that it must be adopted into the directive as we have discussed it here.
