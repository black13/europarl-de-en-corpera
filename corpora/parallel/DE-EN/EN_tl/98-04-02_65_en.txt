Mr President, what Mr Samland of the Committee on Budgets has just said was obvious to us, of course.
This view is shared unreservedly by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy.
I think the Council and its Presidency are aware that they now have to act to make funds available for Bosnia-Herzogovina.
The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy fully supports what Mr Samland said.
