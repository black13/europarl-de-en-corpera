Mr President, as the objectives of the amendments tabled by the Group of the European People's Party and the Group of the Party of European Socialists accommodate each other very well, we also agree with the amendment of the Socialist Group if they agree to insert the word 'democratic' before the word 'Russia' .
The sentence would then read: ' considers that the European Union must develop special links with a democratic Russia...' .
(Parliament approved the oral amendment)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
