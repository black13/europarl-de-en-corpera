Mr President, I abstained from the voting on the Lalumi√®re report, although it is really excellent.
However, some amendments have diluted the report somewhat.
The report does justice to the task, accurately describing Russia as one of the European Union's major partners and specifying a clear strategy for the European Union's cooperation with Russia.
However, I regret that talking about the question of Russia's membership or non-membership of the European Union gave the impression that this was under discussion.
It was not, and is not, under discussion.
If that is made clear, I think we may be content with the report.
