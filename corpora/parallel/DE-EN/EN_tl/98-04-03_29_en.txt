Mr President, I had not intended to slow down our Friday voting, but a short while ago a Dutch colleague drew my attention to the fact that a mistake has crept into the Dutch version of my report, at paragraph 16.
The words 'vis-Ã -vis third countries' are missing at that point.
I would ask you to check this in all language versions on the basis of the original German text.
