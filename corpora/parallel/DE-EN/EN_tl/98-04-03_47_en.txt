Mr President, I am a pilot myself and have experienced the change-over.
The advantages which the satellite navigation systems provide are sensational.
They represent a significant increase in safety, and the computer capacity and the software which lie behind these systems are also a great advantage for a pilot, because they allow your work in the cockpit to be of a significantly higher quality.
I am also pleased that the Commission has informed us that the funding will come from existing resources - from budget line B5-700, among other things.
I believe this decision will have very important implications for competition in Europe, and that competition in this market is urgently needed on a worldwide basis as well.
We know that economic development in particular is very heavily dependent on three factors, namely education and training, research and infrastructure.
All three areas are addressed in the best possible way with this system, and I would like to congratulate Mrs Langenhagen on this report.
