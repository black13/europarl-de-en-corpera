Mr President, pursuant to Rule 19 of our Rules of Procedure, I would like to inform you that the deadline for signing the written declaration 'Sign Against Crime' expires today.
So far 154 Members have signed this written declaration in accordance with Rule 48 of the Rules of Procedure, and I would like to offer them my sincere thanks.
In this respect, I would also like to thank you most sincerely, Mr President, for your readiness to give active support to our concern.
Brussels must become the safest capital in Europe.
As you have rightly commented, we particularly need police reinforcements in the Europe quarter, a police station of our own, and an international, multi-lingual emergency number as a contact point in case of criminal incidents.
According to Rule 19 paragraph 4 of the Rules of Procedure, you represent Parliament in external matters as well.
I would therefore request your continued commitment to representing our concern.
I hope you will soon be able to report something positive to the House.
