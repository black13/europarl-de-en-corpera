Mr President, I knew you were an understanding man.
I am sure you will also find a Rule which makes it possible for me to speak for a minute and a half.
As someone who deals with cooperation between the police and justice systems in the European Union, I support the concern of my colleague Mr Rübig in principle.
Please do not clap too soon.
Mr President, please subtract the applause and the heckling from my speaking time.
I support it in principle, Mr Rübig, because you are defending the safety of our colleagues in this Parliament.
I merely want you to bear in mind something I consider to be very important in negotiations with the Belgian authorities.
Apart from anything else, we play a role in the lack of safety in the Leopold quarter.
In the eyes of a great many people, including criminals of course, we are people worth attacking.
This leads to the situation - you were right to use your hammer in support, Mr President - whereby the people who live in the Leopold quarter on a day-to-day basis are of course victims of crime as well - in other words the Belgians, who suffer at our hands in any case because prices have been driven up because of the European Parliament, as far as rents and land prices are concerned.
So in future please let us not just mention ourselves, but also the people who live there.
The police station which is to be established there is to serve Belgian citizens as well.
I consider it right and proper, Mr Rübig, that we should mention all the affected parties.
