Mr President, this is a question not only of economic growth, but of economic growth which makes sense.
A European economic policy means a socio-ecological market economy.
This requires not only the rapid introduction of the energy tax - and here I would thank Mr Monti for his energetic work - but also a social and environmental situation and also a Union.
What has the annual report to do with the frightening percentages achieved by a right-wing party in Germany?
A great deal.
Unemployment and youth unemployment create helplessness, and the right wing parties in Germany and throughout Europe benefit from that.
On 2 May we will celebrate the historic creation of a single European currency here in the European Parliament.
This is good and I am delighted about it.
In conclusion, I would like to say that I am happy because it will be an historic fact and because monetary union, which in ten years' time will be taken for granted, will be rid of its doom and gloom merchants, including those in my own group!
