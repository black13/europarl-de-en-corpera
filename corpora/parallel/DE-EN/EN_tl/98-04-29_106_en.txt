Mr President, in spite of this report's rather over-optimistic slant, it covers all the relevant points with great clarity.
Given that - as everyone knows - Europe's main problem is excessive unemployment, and we must realise that it is essentially a structural problem.
The competitiveness of the European economy frankly leaves a lot to be desired.
We must, therefore, urgently increase resources for research and for the promotion of state-of-the-art technology both at European and national level.
We must place at the top of the agenda measures to promote competition favouring small and mediumsized enterprises, including a decrease in their administrative burden and an easing of access to risk capital.
The issue of occasionally but obviously excessive fringe benefits and the reduction of the tax burden on work will be priorities for European economic policy over the coming years.
