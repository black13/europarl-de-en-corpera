Mr President, this will now go forward to the Council and the Commission.
You have before you my motions for an amendment.
Briefly, they concern increasing the ecological awareness of the whole textile industry.
This is not the first time that I have raised this topic.
There are detailed debates and discussions on this subject, including some with Commissioner Bangemann.
So I would ask what plans the Commission has and what procedure the Council intends to implement in terms of urgently increasing the ecological orientation of the textile industry, for example, in relation to the removal of pollutants in textiles themselves which can lead to allergies, and in relation to the danger to employees in manufacturing these products, as well as the danger to the environment through air, soil and water pollution?
Mr Bangemann told me here a year ago that there was a working group dealing with this issue.
Guidelines were being drawn up.
That is one thing.
My various inquiries to the Commission - in writing, too - have produced no response, in other words, there is no answer to them.
I would like to hear what you have to say about this.
I have one final point about child labour.
As you know, child labour in the clothing and textile industries, particularly in Portugal, is mentioned in a wide range of opinions by the European Parliament.
This is a dreadful phenomenon in Europe, and I would ask you to clarify your position on this too.
