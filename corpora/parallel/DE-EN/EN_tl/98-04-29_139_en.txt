Mr President, almost two years ago the Florence European Council called for a report from the Commission on the value of dual vocational training.
In my country, this form of training has a long tradition.
Knowledge is acquired, skills are learnt through training, social behaviour and the ability to integrate are learnt through practice.
The very practical nature of dual training qualifies young people for the ever more complex demands of the labour markets and helps to reduce youth unemployment considerably.
The basis for this is cooperation between schools and businesses.
If it works and is constantly checked for new challenges from the point of view of education, organization and content, then the dual system has a future and offers a future to others.
However, within Europe, dual systems are still different, as indicated by Mr Castagnetti in his excellent report, so we must bring them closer together, aiming for European vocational training channels whilst actively involving employers and employees.
Measures in the Member States acquire a European added value at the same time as subsidiarity and responsibility for vocational training are preserved.
This is made possible through intensive exchanges of information and experience, through implementing model projects and promoting mobility and trips abroad, tailor-made for individuals and financed by Community programmes such as the Leonardo da Vinci programme.
Today we are debating and tomorrow we will adopt two important issues simultaneously.
Firstly, there is the convergence report on the euro and the Member States.
But we are also looking at part of the future of vocational training.
If everything goes according to plan, from 1 January 1999 we will have a single currency and a common vocational training programme.
The path from the internal market to the European domestic market involves small steps as well as large ones.
