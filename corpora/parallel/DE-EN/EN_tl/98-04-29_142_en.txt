Mr President, there can be no doubt that the superb report by Mr Castagnetti is a milestone on the way to better youth employment.
The report highlights two core elements.
One is the mobility of young people, which must be increased in order to increase their opportunities.
The second is the actual qualification and the quality of training.
This must generally be raised, especially in the area of qualifications for skilled workers, and this is an issue that has been mentioned here many times.
Without doubt, mobility will be increased by the proposals, by means of mutual recognition, documenting vocational training in a Europass and pulling down bureaucratic barriers.
The other element is dual training which will increase quality.
One problem is the fact that we are training far too many young people for the wrong careers.
In my country, we train up to 80 % of young people for only eleven careers, so the chances of finding an adequate job are correspondingly low.
I would, therefore, like to add a proposal to this excellent report, a proposal which might bring us one more step forward.
We should request that the Commission draws up an annual qualitative occupational needs analysis, which highlights what the labour market really requires in the medium and possibly also in the longer term.
This information should then be made available to countries as a service, to give them something to use on a voluntary basis as a point of reference.
This would mean that they could adjust or convert their vocational training systems so that later, young people would really be trained to meet actual demand in the labour market.
That could be an additional incentive: to train young people to meet precisely this demand and give them the opportunity to find their first job.
This would open up a whole new approach.
