Mr President, I would like to offer an immediate response to the matter just raised.
Last week at the request of Parliament and its President we formed a working group on bioethics in the Committee on Research.
I would like to ask how you envisage cooperation between the Commission's Group on ethics and this ethics group which has now been formally set up in the Committee on Research.
