Mr President, I would like to thank President Santer for his personal involvement in this issue.
President Santer, we were not entirely happy with the work done by the original group.
The debate here over the last year provided evidence of this.
However, I think that by appointing new members and with the increased plurality of the group we will find the work more satisfactory.
In my view, one problem which was particularly evident in the position on human cloning was that there was insufficient time for consultation with the scientific institutes which work in the areas of ethics and science in Europe.
My question is this: in future how will the group integrate the work which is done in Europe and is in part supported by the Commission with the work done by this advisory group - will there be a first reading followed by a report from the institutes which operate in this field, and then a second reading?
