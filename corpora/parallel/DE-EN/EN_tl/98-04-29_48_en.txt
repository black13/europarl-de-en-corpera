Mr President, President Santer, you are full of praise for the new ethics advisory group in the way that a good father speaks well of his children, even if they have failed.
Bravo!
The range of tasks accorded to the advisory group is impressive.
It now covers communication technology, information technology and biotechology.
But there has been no increase in the work to be done.
Instead, top-class experts have had a muzzle put on them.
It may look fine, but it remains a muzzle which prevents the advisory group using its teeth.
Or do you really believe that twelve top-class scientists, men and women, who are used to being very thorough in their work, will be able to carry on working in the same way if the range of their assignments is extended ad infinitum?
