Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr von Wogau, we all know that in the long term only a stable currency can guarantee prosperity and jobs.
The European Parliament, therefore, must state unequivocally today that it takes seriously all the provisions and criteria set out in the Treaty and that these must be strictly and closely observed.
The requirement in the von Wogau report that two Member States consolidate their total debt in accordance with the Treaty is, therefore, correct and necessary.
Close observance of the Treaty should equally be one of the requirements for the appointment of the President of the Central Bank.
If the Treaty states that the period of office is eight years, then this must be the case.
To construe the requirements of the Treaty differently or to manipulate them is wrong and must be utterly rejected by the European Parliament.
The undignified tug-of-war concerning the new President must also stop immediately.
Europe needs confidence, Europe needs clarity, particularly in the sensitive questions about monetary policy.
We know that these days the whole world is watching to see how Europe is dealing with these very issues.
Strict observance of the Treaty is the best visiting card the euro could have.
Not only has the euro earned an excellent start, but it has also earned the right to serve as a long-term global anchor of stability for everyone, first and foremost for Europeans.
This will be possible if we adopt the von Wogau report today with as few amendments as possible.
