Mr President, as a European, I would like to say that I am perfectly happy about meeting here in Brussels on Saturday.
Mr President, I would urge you to press for the release of Vincent Cochetel on behalf of the European Parliament.
Mr Cochetel works for the High Commission for Refugees.
Three months ago today he was kidnapped in Russia.
During the night of 29 January he was taken away by armed men and he has not been seen since.
Mr Cochetel is 37 years old and has two children.
He leads the delegation of the High Commissioner for Refugees in Vladikafkas, which is looking after 100 000 refugees and exiles from the Caucasus region.
I would ask you to intervene and urge you to do everything in your power both here and in the Russian Federation to ensure the release of Vincent Cochetel.
