Mr President, Mr von Wogau, ladies and gentlemen, as I was travelling from Strasbourg to Austria following the last sitting in Strasbourg, I was delighted to note that the frontier barrier between Germany and Austria had been removed.
This time, when I return from Brussels to Austria, there will be a fixed exchange rate between the Deutsche Mark, the schilling and the Belgian franc, and in fact throughout all the 11 states.
This brings great immediate advantages for our companies.
The risks of the exchange rate are removed, and we can make more precise calculations more easily; we will be able to enjoy these advantages next week.
On January 1, we will have a single currency.
That too will bring with it huge advantages, not only for company balance sheets, but also in the comparability of the various deals on offer.
As a result, Europe will become more competitive.
Who would have thought back at the beginning, when discussions about the euro started, that 11 countries would be involved right from the start?
The more pessimistic among us thought there would be 6 or 7 countries.
Today there are 11, and I forecast that by 2002, there will be 15!
It is my belief that countries will not be able to afford to stay outside, and we must think about how we can help those countries who are willing to join.
We have many tasks ahead of us, and I am proud that Europe is able to cope with them!
