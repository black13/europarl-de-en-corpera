Madam President, I am one of the admittedly small number of members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights who voted in committee against some of our rapporteur's amendments, and subsequently also against the directive that had been amended in accordance with his proposals.
I should like to make it clear here that this rejection did not relate to all the changes.
I do give my full support to all the amendments which are aimed at protecting not only those services which are subject to restricted access for commercial reasons, but also to those which are restricted for reasons to do with the security and integrity of the information transmitted.
However, I believe that, for systematic reasons, the right of originators to bring an action, proposed in the report, ought to be dealt with not in this directive, but in the copyright directive which is also currently being dealt with by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, and that it should be considered by them at the same time as aspects which are essentially legal.
Otherwise we shall end up with a proliferation of requirements in a range of different directives, which would be of very little assistance to originators.
However, the greatest substantive problem I have relates, however, to the more or less clearly expressed demand that Member States should also criminalize private ownership of smart cards and similar devices.
This encourages more snooping around in people's homes, and on the whole I also believe that too little consideration is being given to the rights of free access to information.
