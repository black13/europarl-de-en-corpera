Mr President, even before this vote I indicated my wish to speak for a quite simple reason.
Clearly, a translation has been made that is liable to be misunderstood in several languages, and this ambiguous translation for Amendment No 29 may also lead to a quite different outcome in the vote.
We are dealing here with a measure against youth unemployment.
Many young people are qualified for the wrong occupations, for occupations for which there is no demand.
That is why we have here the proposal that the Commission should ascertain which occupations really are in demand, with a qualitative analysis of occupational needs.
This analysis should then be made available to the Member States, and the Member States will decide whether or not they make use of this information and change their training plans.
In other words, we are dealing with the provision of a service, and Member States will decide on a voluntary basis whether or not to make changes.
This appears in several translations as a binding proposal, and as a result it may lead to a distortion of the voting outcome.
I would ask you therefore to allow the voting on Amendment No 29 to be repeated.
