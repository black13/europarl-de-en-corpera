Madam President, I should like to enquire when the results in connection with the declaration on crime in Brussels will appear in the Minutes.
According to the Minutes, Mr Schulz said that we are concentrating only on the protection of employees of the European institutions.
I should, however, like to stress that we are, of course, equally concerned with the protection of all citizens in Brussels.
