Mr President, I am sorry, but from here I was just not able to see as well as you could that in the case of Amendments Nos 3, 4 and 5 by the Green Group in the European Parliament there really was a clear majority of votes against.
To be quite honest, I cannot understand it either, because in Question Time on the issue yesterday the Council and the Commission were in agreement with it.
It has been confirmed.
There are already working groups in the ecological area of the textile industry.
