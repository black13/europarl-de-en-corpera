Mr President, the European Parliament seems all set to vote by a large majority for a premature birth.
A baby named euro is to come into the world at a time when important conditions for its harmonious development and functioning have still to be met.
Since we consider it wrong to induce a premature birth when this is not absolutely necessary, we Members of the Austrian Freedom Party intend to vote against the proposal.
In doing so I am not speaking against the baby euro as such.
It is in the interests of the citizens of Europe that this premature birth does not become a miscarriage.
But every effort now needs to be made to push ahead vigorously with those stages of the harmonization process which are still to be completed, so that monetary union is put on a secure footing.
As one who intends voting against today's proposal, I should like to express my commitment to support these efforts and to call upon all Members who also intend voting 'no' not to look too much to the past but rather to adopt a critical, yet constructive approach towards the future of our new currency...
(The President asked the speaker to stand down as the speaking time had been exceeded)
