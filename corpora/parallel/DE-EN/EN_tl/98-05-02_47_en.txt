Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the euro is the strongest bond which we have yet devised for holding together the different states of our European Union.
Speaking as an Austrian, I am proud that my country is to join monetary union in the first wave and I am glad that our main trading partners, particularly Germany and Italy, are to do likewise.
Nevertheless, a fair measure of tact and intuition will still be needed to demonstrate to our people that we have a united Europe, a citizens' Europe, and that we wish to strengthen these ties by adopting the euro.
Concerns about employment and the need to safeguard jobs are key elements here.
We have to demonstrate that a figure of 20 million unemployed is absolutely unacceptable.
We must show day after day that we have been economizing so that we can have a more healthy and more productive system of government which can operate a positive employment policy.
The taxation system must be reformed so that European entrepreneurs are encouraged to create jobs.
The idea of the euro and monetary union has already penetrated our thinking, but many of our citizens have not yet taken it to their hearts.
This is the task which we will have to accomplish in the years ahead.
