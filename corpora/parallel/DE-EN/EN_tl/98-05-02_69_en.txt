Madam President, today a vision has become a reality.
The euro will be a new symbol of the unity of Europe.
It will lay the necessary foundations for greater investment, solid growth and lasting employment.
The working population of Europe, in other words the great majority of our citizens, will benefit from a situation in which inflation rates are low, public debt is down, long-term interest rates are falling and exchange-rate fluctuations are no longer to be a factor.
The Commission has now informed us, the European Parliament, of its recommendation for the eleven countries which are to comprise the euro area.
The day before yesterday we delivered our opinion, as we did again a few moments ago.
At this juncture I wish to express thanks to the German Chancellor, Helmut Kohl, for his tenacity and for the ability he has shown in giving early political impetus to the euro project.
He has demonstrated enormous staying power and has consistently refused to be put off by the ditherers and by those lacking objectivity.
It is this attitude which is the basis for our justified confidence in the euro and in the future stability of Europe.
