Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, some here would like to get the directive on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions out of the way with all possible speed.
That is not the task of the European Parliament.
Our task is to ensure that at second reading we do not allow the Council to deprive us of what we agreed at first reading.
Otherwise we shall be creating a dangerous precedent which will undermine the rights of Parliament.
That is why there are some amendments to the common position which we simply must accept.
I shall limit myself to two examples.
Firstly, even if we have decided that the building blocks of human life and parts of the entire animal and plant world may be patented as inventions, we should not be throwing the doors wide open to bio-piracy.
That is why at first reading we demanded at least evidence of the origin of biological material.
This will prevent misuse, and if necessary will allow claims for damages.
The Council deleted this.
We must write evidence of origin back in.
Secondly: we must preserve the ethics committee in the form which we agreed.
The new European Group on Ethics appointed by the Commission, whose tasks range from communications technology to bio- and gene technology, is not good enough.
How on earth can twelve scientists, even top-flight ones, seriously cover the whole field of modern technologies, alongside their main activity?
In an area which is full of hopes and fears, our fellow citizens are expecting reliable guidance, not a token body.
That is why the European Parliament must hold out for a separate committee on bio-ethics in the context of the patents directive.
