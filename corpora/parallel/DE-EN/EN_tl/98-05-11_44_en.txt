Madam President, some considerable time ago 1.2 million of my compatriots signed a petition to put on record their opposition to the patenting of biotechnological inventions.
Against this politically explosive background, I have read this report even more carefully than usual.
The observation that the Commission and the Council's common position have taken up amendments from Parliament does not stand up to close scrutiny.
There has been a weakening of significant points by surreptitious means.
The Council's common position specifies in Article 5, paragraph 2 that an isolated component of the human body can be an invention that can be patented.
This provision is a de facto circumvention of the ban on cloning human life forms.
It is further specified that the use of human embryos for industrial and commercial purposes may not be patented.
The exclusion of patentability thus does not cover the use of embryos for therapeutic and diagnostic purposes.
I, however, think that all use of human embryos ought to be excluded from patentability!
The original position of the Parliament concerning the so-called "farmers' privilege' has also been weakened.
The derogations envisaged are nonsense, because although farmers are permitted to use crop material for generative and vegetative reproduction, economic exploitation of the application patents is deliberately excluded from the derogations.
As a result, there can be no exchange of seed material between farmers without the payment of licence fees.
Small seed associations will go out of existence for economic reasons.
The result will be a market cleansing.
The same also applies to animal breeding.
For these reasons, we reject the draft.
