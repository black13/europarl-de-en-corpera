Madam President, the rapporteur and all those who advocate accepting the common position of the Council have recognized that the present common position contains improvements over the draft at first reading.
Mr Rothley, that is an acknowledgement of criticism, because at that time you wanted to accept the original common position.
If we had followed your advice, we would not have these improvements today, and this report would be linked to your name and it would be worse than the other one.
Let me make myself clear: I am in favour of a directive, but I am also in favour of it being qualitatively sensible throughout.
I am rapporteur for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and the so-called "farmers' privilege' has been improved in the present common position by comparison with the first draft.
However, what the Agriculture Committee wanted, and what this Parliament voted for, has not been included.
Mr Rothley, you should not give up before you cross the finishing line.
Even if you are exhausted, I can keep going!
We have worked together on this issue for 10 years, and that is why I am in favour of having an argument with the Council and going into the conciliation procedure with this amendment which we have once again proposed.
I am fairly sure that either the Council will not even launch the conciliation procedure and will immediately accept the point, or we will get our way in the conciliation procedure.
Why should we give up the opportunity of an improvement when we both support the same position on this point, because, as has been said, the draft from the Council lacks internal conviction and logic.
So, Mr Rothley, please listen to the critics one more time and show a little patience, then we shall have an improved draft, and then Parliament will be in a strong position in its argument with the Council.
