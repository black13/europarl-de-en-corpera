Madam President, the Group of the Party of European Socialists will agree with the substance of the Wijsenbeek report.
I should like to comment on the institutional aspect of this problem.
I do not believe that the Commission is competent to place communications on the interpretation of legal documents in the public domain.
Neither the European Parliament nor the Council - in other words, the two legislators in the European Community - expresses views before the European Court of Justice on the interpretation of a legal document which they have enacted.
The Commission has still less authority to express views on the interpretation of legal documents which the European Parliament and the Council have enacted.
In this area there is no competence attaching to the Commission.
That is why such communications, insofar as they are intended to expound legal effects, which is indeed the intention, are unlawful.
I believe this is a profoundly political problem.
The European Union suffers from the fact that it presents a diffuse image to the public.
No one knows exactly who is responsible for what.
Who is accountable?
That is why we must take account of such matters, I believe, we must take account of responsibilities.
Moreover, the European Court of Justice confirmed this last year, when it declared such a communication from the Commission - it must have been in February - to be unlawful.
That is why, Commissioner, if we are to maintain this clear responsibility, if we are to ensure that in the eyes of others the European Union has a clear profile and shape, it would be helpful for the Commission to refrain from such communications in future.
Either there is a necessity for a directive to be changed, and in that case the Commission can make a new proposal, or there is no such necessity, and in that case it should leave well alone!
