Mr President, this is a vote in the European Parliament and, if I understand matters correctly, those who are entitled to vote in the European Parliament are the Members of this House.
There is clearly a troupe of actors in costumes in the Chamber.
I would ask you to refrain from voting...
... or else to acknowledge what you are, namely freely elected Members of this House and not a Punch and Judy show!
(Applause)
