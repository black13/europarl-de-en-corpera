Mr President, it is a question of the dignity of this House, as has already been said.
I should like to say to one of the previous speakers: you ought to pay a visit to a Punch and Judy show, then you would see that Punch and Judy is one of our cultural treasures.
But there is one thing that I would ask for, and that is an apology from Mr Ferber.
If he thinks that he can call our group a band of pirates, then he knows nothing about dignity, democratic argument or style.
I await an apology from you, and if that is not forthcoming, then we all know what to think!
(Applause from the Green Group)
