Mr President, there was a certain amount of bad temper in yesterday's discussion of these amendments.
It was claimed that the amendments had not been submitted by the Committee on Agriculture.
Well, there is not the slightest possibility of any committee introducing an amendment in this procedure, not even the Committee on Agriculture.
That is why it was decided that, as rapporteur in this matter, I should collect the signatures of members of the Committee on Agriculture, and these appear in the list below the amendments.
Our committee has also written a letter to the Committee on Legal Affairs, expressing the fact that our interests are at stake and I am talking here about the right of farmers to continue breeding animals and plants.
I just wanted to draw this fact to your attention.
(The President declared the common position approved)
