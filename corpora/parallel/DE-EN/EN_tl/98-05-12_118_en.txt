Mr President, please allow me to pass on to you and to everyone else present a quite shattering piece of news.
I have just learnt that an hour ago an attempt was made on the life of the President of the Turkish Association for the Defence of Human Rights, Mr Akin Birdal.
Many of you will have been acquainted with him personally.
Eight armed civilians entered the offices of the Committee for the Defence of Human Rights in Ankara.
Mr Birdal, and no-one else, was shot and suffered serious injuries.
His condition is critical and he is now in hospital.
A number of Parliamentary colleagues who were in Ankara two weeks ago with the EU-Turkey Joint Parliamentary Committee met Mr Akin Birdal.
I very much hope that he will survive his injuries.
Many of you know Akin.
He is a symbol of a democratic Turkey, a Turkey which is fighting for human rights.
We all hope that he will survive this attack and that those who were responsible will be found and brought to justice.
