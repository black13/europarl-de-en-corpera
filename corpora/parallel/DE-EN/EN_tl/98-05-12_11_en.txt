Mr President, yesterday evening I proposed that the deadline for amendments should be set at 8.30 p.m.
I realized that this would not work particularly well.
But I would like to ask my colleague, Mr Giansily, to consider whether he could not achieve the same thing either by an oral amendment or by a separate vote.
It is after all only a question of the words "for 8 years' , and of whether there can be a separate vote on this issue.
I therefore request that we invite the experts on the Rules of Procedure to examine whether this possibility exists.
This would mean that our colleague, Mr Giansily, is being treated fairly, because it is entirely legitimate for him to make this demand.
The problem was that we had to work exceptionally quickly and a deadline for amendments was therefore not necessary.
The problem we are dealing with here is essentially a political one.
That is why I take the view that my colleague, Mr Giansily, has the right to express his opinion on this issue.
While this does not concur with my own view in this particular case - which is quite an unusual turn of events - I nevertheless consider it legitimate that this opinion should be expressed.
