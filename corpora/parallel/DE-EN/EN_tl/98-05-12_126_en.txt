Mr President, the Green Group was united in voting against the Rothley report.
We consider it to be completely irresponsible from an ethical point of view that the way is being opened up for thousands of genes - whether from human beings, plants or animals - to be put to commercial use.
Parliament has given dispensation for a massive push towards the commercialization of the human body.
It is also disgraceful that Parliament has so clearly caved in to the huge lobbying interests of industry.
Only three years ago Parliament had the courage to reject this very same report.
Today it is agreeing to virtually the same document.
It surely demonstrates the inadequacy of Parliament that we are simply swallowing whatever the Commission serves up, or as it would say: let us allow Parliament to go on voting until the result suits us.
I think that the lobbying in support of the patents directive was one of the most aggressive that the European Parliament has ever experienced.
But that should not prevent Parliament from allowing ethical sense to prevail.
Parliament has failed pitifully.
It has failed to create a clear legal framework which sets down ethical limits for industry.
It has legalized bio-piracy and the road which leads there is now ready for multinationals to travel down.
They will be able to re-interpret the genes of plants, animals and human beings, which they have done no more than discover, as their own invention and to designate them as their property.
The patents directive will lead to an enormous privatization of nature, and it is a disgrace that it is also leaving the back-door open for the cloning of parts of the human body and the patenting of human embryos for research purposes.
It is disgraceful that the directive has not even succeeded in excluding things of this kind.
I think that today is a black day for human rights since human beings are clearly being debased by this patents directive and will become nothing more than raw materials for industry.
