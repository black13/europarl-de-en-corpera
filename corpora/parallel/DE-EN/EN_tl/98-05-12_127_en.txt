Mr President, if the patents directive which has now been adopted by Parliament is better than the one we debated and then rejected in Parliament the first time around, it is thanks to those who essentially voted against the directive at that time.
We saw to it that improvements were made, and in my view the wording which has now been adopted cannot be compared with what we rejected in Parliament on that previous occasion.
But I am also of the opinion that we should have completed the procedure and should have confirmed at second reading what Parliament voted for by a large majority at first reading.
This would have enabled us to go into the conciliation procedure with the Council armed with real possibilities for putting forward, and having accepted, views which a majority in Parliament voted for at the first passage.
Parliament has not made full use of its potential here and we have ended up badly placed vis-Ã -vis the Council and the Commission, despite the fact that we are normally anxious to ensure that Parliament's position is strengthened.
This we failed to do on this particular occasion, and that is why I too voted against the amendments.
