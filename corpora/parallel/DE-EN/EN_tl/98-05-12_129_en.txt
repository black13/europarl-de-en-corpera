Mr President, I wish to raise a point of order.
Earlier on I approached the Chair to have my name put down for an oral voting declaration not just on the Pirker report but also on the Rothley document.
I was wrongly informed that only written voting statements would be allowed.
But I assume that what applies to my colleagues applies to me as well, and I should therefore like to make an oral voting declaration.
(The President.
No, no!)
But surely, Mr President, I was given the wrong information.
I was told that there are only written declarations in the case of second readings.
But since Mrs Breyer, Mrs Banotti and many others have been allowed to make oral declarations, I consider it important, on the basis of equal treatment, that I too should be allowed to make my own voting declaration orally.
