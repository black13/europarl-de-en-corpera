Mr President, as I said before, I did not wish to criticize anyone, I simply wanted everyone to have the same rights.
I share the opinion of my colleague, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, that we have succeeded in improving essential aspects of the directive.
I take the view, and this goes well beyond my colleague's position, that we have made major improvements to the directive and I am proud to be one of those who offered strong resistance to it the first time around.
It was said at the time that, if we say no, there would never be legislation, there would never be any directive, and better a bad regulation than no regulation at all.
All this talk has been proved wrong.
The directive before us today is now very much improved.
Nonetheless, I would have preferred it if we had done what my colleague Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf proposed on a number of points, including primarily the four amendments on embryo protection, in other words, I wish we had completed the procedure in full.
I take the view that we should have adopted a series of amendments and for this reason I voted in favour of just such a thing.
