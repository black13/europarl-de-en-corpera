Mr President, I simply wanted to say briefly that I am very pleased to see such a large majority in support of the Pirker report, for this constitutes a turning point in EU drugs policy which first became evident in the debate on the d'Ancona report, which unfortunately was referred back to committee.
The Pirker report has finally made it clear that there is in this House a large majority in favour of a hard and clear line against drugs.
I believe that what is important now is to ensure that this change of direction is also taken up by the individual Member States.
In Germany, for example, the debate has fallen a long way behind the position we reached on this issue in the European Parliament.
I only wish there were as much unity of purpose over drugs policy and the fight against drugs in national politics as there is in the European Parliament.
