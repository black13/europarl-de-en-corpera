Mr President, when we talk of water or water quality, we need to be clear that there is only one body of water in the world.
Dividing water into two types - one which we can pollute and poison and use as a vehicle for carrying away our rubbish, and one which we need for our vital requirements - is just not a viable long-term proposition.
That is why we must provide the best possible protection for our entire water system in every corner of the globe, because the Earth's water system all connects up together.
This report - and here I repeat myself - naturally constitutes the right step in the right direction.
Wrong decisions taken mainly in the past, such as the use of lead pipes which are a threat to human health, should be corrected as soon as possible.
The introduction of thresholds for radioactivity is no less important.
Given that the disinfection of water is particularly good business for the chemical industry, it will be important in future to ensure that the addition of chemicals is kept to an absolute minimum.
