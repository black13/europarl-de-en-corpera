Mr President, it has been stated that copper presents no risk to health.
That is simply incorrect.
Very young children, for example, can be seriously harmed by this substance if a certain genetic predisposition is present.
There have been actual cases of cirrhosis of the liver in infants.
There was a case in Austria where a mother prepared tea for her child every day with the first water that came out of the tap in the morning.
This water contained copper accumulated overnight from the copper piping.
The child died.
This was complicated by the fact that the mother used a copper kettle to prepare the tea.
Very young children can therefore die from the effects of copper poisoning.
People have got to be made aware of this.
