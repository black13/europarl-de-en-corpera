Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, European and national measures to control air pollution have been in force for almost 20 years.
But traffic continues to be one of the main sources of pollution.
Our group has from the outset underlined the importance of combating pollution at its source.
This is also the objective of the two directives which are dealt with in the reports presented by Mrs Hautala and Mrs Pollack.
Our group also supports basic proposals for improvement in this area, although I think it important that the new legislation should be compatible with other basic provisions, such as the IPC directives dealing with plant approval.
In many Member States there is also the problem of inherited contamination, due to the centuries-long practice of ore mining.
This long-term degradation means that greater levels of contamination are to be found in and around lead smelting works, and pollution of this kind can hardly be reduced by the required amount in the period of time prescribed.
I therefore think that a tightly drawn derogation is necessary in this area.
The relevant amendment which has been proposed by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection goes too far in my view and would in practice make derogations possible for just about every town and city.
That is why I have introduced my amendment.
Furthermore, I would ask for consideration to be given to a typical problem which is encountered on the borders with the former Eastern bloc countries of Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland.
While we should continue to keep a record of the high quantities of pollutants which, for the foreseeable future, will continue to be blown into our territory from these countries, this contamination should not be charged to the EU countries when emission thresholds are being assessed.
I call on you to support these amendments and I would also like to ask the Commission if it is prepared to accept them.
