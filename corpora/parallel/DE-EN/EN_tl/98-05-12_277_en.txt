Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think it is very sensible that a supplementary question can also be put during Question Time.
I frequently make use of this facility, but what we have been witnessing in the course of the last few questions is not the putting of supplementary questions but rather - with all due respect - the exchange of pleasantries.
While this may well be good for the mood of the House, it does not help me much because I shall not now be able to put my question since the session will shortly be closed.
Mr President, I would ask you to chair the session rather more tightly.
