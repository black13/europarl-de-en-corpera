Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in its communication on a Europe of Knowledge the Commission provides guidelines for the next generation of European training programmes.
I think that anyone who is involved in politics, whether at a European level or within the Member States, is aware of the crucial importance which thorough planning of our customary training programmes will have for the European Union in the 21st century.
However, is it a prerequisite of a successful working life to ensure that as many different people as possible have a general education and vocational training?
Do programmes which promote the European exchange of culture and training or look after the education of the young individual contribute significantly to the political integration of the Union?
In this context I welcome the Commission's plan to simplify the administration which will be required to implement the programmes and to ensure greater openness and transparency in its organization.
It also seems important to me, however, to lend continuity to incentive measures in the area of training.
It is specifically in schools and in the area of youth that cooperation structures have been built over the years.
They represent a potential which we should take advantage of.
I therefore consider it important that the three programmes be continued separately in their current form.
We should attempt, in doing so, to introduce improvements into the existing system by building on a careful evaluation of programmes to date.
In any case, the network of solid human relations that has been established with the help of previous programmes and which is also the goal of these programmes must not threatened by changes which are meant well but are not well thought out.
Finally, I would like to offer Mr Perry my congratulations on his very good report.
