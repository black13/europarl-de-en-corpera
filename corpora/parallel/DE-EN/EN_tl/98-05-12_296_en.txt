Mr President, the financing issue mentioned again and again here is unfortunately only a part of the solution.
What is still lacking are programmes whose content concentrates not only on learning but also on learning needs.
Also missing are direct links to other areas.
One example of such a link would be the Dutch report, "Culture 2000' , which for the first time creates a link between education, a training programme and the culture market in a country.
So people no longer say that culture requires more and more money and more and more subsidies but that there is a solution to subsidies in the area of culture if we learn more, experience more, buy more books, go to the cinema more often, visit more museums and thus spend more money on the culture market.
This report, however, also mentions briefly the problem of language, which has not yet been discussed here.
The problem of language diversity in Europe cannot be reduced to a purely practical problem; instead, it must take into account the cultural needs of the individual countries.
