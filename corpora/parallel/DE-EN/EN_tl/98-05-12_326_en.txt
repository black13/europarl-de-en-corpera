Mr President, when we requested that a human rights clause be included in the new agreement with Mexico the government called it unacceptable interference in internal matters.
The same argument is now being used to expel international observers from Mexico.
Such diversions damage our confidence in future improvements in relations.
Yet the people of Mexico have high expectations of the new EU/Mexico relations, particularly where human rights are concerned.
We should not disappoint them.
The clause must not remain an insignificant piece of rhetoric and the agreement must not be a general absolution for the government.
We know that the Mexican government needs the approval of the treaty as a sign of international recognition as its reputation in its own country is diminishing constantly and we would very much like to give this approval if it helps human rights.
An important step would be a rapidly drawn-up report on the human rights situation.
Is the Commission prepared to present such a report to the EP at short notice?
Will the Commission present an annual report to the Parliament?
Will it involve human rights groups in the drafting of the report?
Will there be someone in the EU delegation who is responsible specifically for human rights?
How does the Commission wish to involve Mexico's civil society in political dialogue?
Without these elements we will not be able to approve a global agreement.
Then the interim agreement would not serve any purpose either.
We therefore urgently require specific information which is not based solely on statements from Mexico's government as, unfortunately, theory and practice have so far been too far apart there.
This is something we owe to ourselves and to Mexican society.
