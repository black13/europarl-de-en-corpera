Mr President, first I would like to thank the rapporteur for the very useful suggestions put forward in detail in this report.
One area of transit is the problem of fraud, which is quite a considerable one.
In the last year we have had 5 162 cases with a total loss of ECU 1.4 billion; this is a considerable sum and also represents an enormous cost for the EU budget.
Another area is the huge number of daily goods deliveries.
It is the role of customs to carry out inspections, to ensure smooth handling and to ensure that government revenue is correctly paid.
Senders and receivers want to transport their goods from A to B quickly and as simply and cheaply as possible; the forwarding agent also wants to transport the goods simply and cheaply.
We must bear in mind that in the European Union we are concerned primarily with small businesses, SMEs; for this reason procedures for the majority of goods transport must be as straightforward as possible.
There are of course sensitive areas, such as tobacco, alcohol and agriculture.
Here, procedures must of course be very strict and every care must be taken to ensure that there is no illegal trafficking.
While ensuring these sensitive procedures for an infinitely small sector of goods transport we must not, however, forget those for which procedures must be simple and practical.
