Mr President, I have just been considering the dangers which would be posed to society by parachutists who are on drugs.
After all, Mr Dupuis did mention parachutists.
But on a more serious note, I should like to give my most sincere congratulations to the rapporteur on his report.
It always reassures me to know that reports on this particular issue are being dealt with by the rapporteur in question, because I believe that his involvement guarantees that our children will not be put at risk by misguided liberalism.
The particular characteristics and side-effects of the synthetic drugs described in the report - and particularly the tendency of leisure addicts, if I can use the term, to seriously underestimate the effects of their habit - account for the special threat which they pose.
The fact that these fashionable drugs are being distributed for profit as part of a new organized-crime network means that the measures being proposed in the report, and particularly those aimed at an effective system of prevention, have now become a matter of urgency.
We shall accept the report for all these reasons.
