Mr President, Commissioner, you cannot base health policy measures such as the ban on tobacco advertising on Article 100a because that is expressly forbidden in Article 129.
That is the legal position.
That is why a majority of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights considered that the Community had no regulatory powers whatsoever in this matter.
Of course, that is going very wide of the mark.
The Union does have powers in relation to crossborder advertising, and it should make use of them, and in my opinion this should include tobacco advertising as well.
But an outright ban, or a ban on free gifts in the Member States, is not covered by Article 100a.
This is why the Commission ought to act under Article 129 (2) to see that a ban is imposed in the countries concerned - insofar as that is possible - in the interest of public health.
Anyone who does not want to lose the case before the European Court of Justice should at least vote for Frau Roth-Berendt's amendments.
