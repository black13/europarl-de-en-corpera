Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have every respect for those who oppose smoking and want to ban the advertising of tobacco products.
But we are not here to decide on our convictions or on a political resolution, we are here to decide on a European legislative proposal, something which is to become European law.
The European Union is a community in law.
It can only make laws if it is empowered to do so in the Treaty.
In the view of most people who have dealt with this matter, there is no legal basis in the Treaty for this directive.
So the Union is taking upon itself a right that it does not possess.
This was made clear in the expert opinion delivered by the Council's Legal Service in 1993, which states that the Legal Service concludes that the proposal for a directive cannot be accepted either on the basis of Article 100a or on the basis of any other Article of the Treaty.
This opinion has never been revoked.
That is why, in legal terms, this directive rests on shaky foundations.
It could be based on Article 100a only if it concerned harmonization.
But it does not harmonize, it bans.
It is also clear from the procedure that we are dealing here with a health directive.
That is why, quite logically, the Commissioner for Health is sitting here and defending it.
That is why the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has taken the lead in Parliament, rather than the committee on competition.
In short, if this directive becomes law, then we as a Parliament will be doing exactly what we are always reproaching the Commission for doing, namely laying claim to powers which are a matter for the Member States.
That is why we should reflect on this very carefully!
