Mr President, the report ignores the fact that there are different views of what constitutes suitable security plans within Europe.
In addition, it is a great mistake for the European Parliament, during the ratification process of the Treaty of Amsterdam, to be dragging out plans which were rejected by the Amsterdam summit itself.
The idea that the EU can guarantee security in Europe with a common defence policy is a throwback to the time of the Cold War.
And the Cold War is over.
The EU has enormous advantages over the institutions of the Cold War.
Why do we not want to use them?
It has instruments for the integration of good relations between neighbours.
It can create balance, it can build up close economic relations and on this basis offer strong economic cooperation and financial support.
It is also these instruments which will enable the EU to assume the responsibility at world level which it needs to ensure common survival in this world.
With a defence policy, on the other hand, Europe will be living dangerously because the problems of today's world can no longer be solved by confrontations, threats and provocations.
We have experienced just such provocation in the last few days as India triggered a new race for the production of the machinery of destruction with its nuclear tests.
The Greens absolutely reject this form of employment creation measure for the industrial armaments facilities of the EU States and instead advocate the strengthening of disarmament and conversion projects.
