Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report prepared by Mr Tindemans sends out a very positive signal because it is, at long last, a document which clearly highlights the European Union's responsibility for its own security.
Because what is the question here?
In theory, our entire foreign and security policy has been established since Maastricht.
In practice, however, it is a fiasco, as we all know.
So what does it mean?
What is the objective?
Not just to condemn, but also to invalidate the misuse of force in politics!
That we shall be able to achieve when the European Union is finally able to distance itself from individual national security policies and instead combine the political, the economic and, at the end of the day, the military potential of the Union in the interests of crisis management and peace-keeping.
They both amount to the same thing.
The second issue which I would like to highlight is the following: Since Maastricht, we have been working towards the objective of a common foreign and security policy and we have been saying that we want to make the Western European Union an instrument of the European Union.
Perhaps we should stop talking about it and actually get on and do it!
Lastly, many people would prefer to leave the security of the European Union in the hands of Washington.
In my view that would be a pity!
For, quite legitimately, American security policy is concerned with safeguarding its own interests.
Secondly, American security policy very, very often depends on the prevailing domestic political situation.
Under certain circumstances, that could actually represent a security risk for Europe.
We must therefore continue to pursue the goal of a common foreign and security policy, merge the EU and the Western European Union in the interests of crisis management and peace-keeping, not only in Europe, but at world level.
