Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, like the previous speaker I find it extremely worrying that India has carried out these tests and that no criticism is coming from inside the country itself.
Given this fact, the sanctions which have been announced are more likely to result in an act of defiance than any sort of understanding that as a large, democratic country in the region India also has a duty to set an example to its neighbours.
A show of strength may achieve the desired domestic effect for the moment, but this will be far outweighed by the damage it will cause at international level.
A State which cannot solve the problem of poverty in its own country should not be seeking to enhance its domestic reputation through demonstrations of this kind.
The last thing we need in a developing country is an arms race.
Already, India spends 12.5 % and Pakistan 27 % of its budget on military expenditure.
In view of the arms race in the region, however, calling for India alone to put an end to testing would now seem to offer little chance of success.
The European Union must also ask itself whether, after the French tests in the Pacific, it did not sit back a little in relief rather than making energetic calls for more countries to join up to the existing Treaty.
