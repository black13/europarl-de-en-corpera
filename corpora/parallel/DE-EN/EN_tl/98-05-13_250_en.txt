Madam President, Kosovo is currently one of the major political problems and major trouble spots in Europe.
We wanted to find another time to discuss the matter.
But we were told that it would be better to do it today since a Council statement was scheduled and the debate had therefore been arranged for today when we set the agenda on Monday.
Then yesterday at 5.00 p.m., when almost no one was in the Chamber, it was suddenly announced that today's agenda had been changed and now we find ourselves in a situation where the debate on Kosovo is due to take place after the debate on the nuclear tests in India has been squeezed in.
A statement from the Council which is not followed by a debate is nothing more than a Council press conference!
Why do we need a European Parliament if contributions to the debate are banished to the night.
Mr Titley's proposal really is the most acceptable compromise.
We are already very loathe to accept it, but what you have suggested is no compromise, it is simply the original proposal.
