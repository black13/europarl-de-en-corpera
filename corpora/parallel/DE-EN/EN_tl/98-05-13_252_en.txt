Madam President, I have only one thing to say.
Question Time has so often been shifted in the past because certain parties did not like the questions, that I would suggest the discussion on Kosovo should take place now.
That is simply the most logical solution.
It is a burning issue for us.
And it is nonsensical that we should be dealing with a non-European matter instead of such a vitally important issue as the Kosovo question.
I would therefore strongly urge you to consider this solution.
