Mr President, as a pilot I myself am often in the air and it occurs to me that, contrary to what we may imagine, with Eurocontrol in particular, interfaces often do not meet safety standards.
I believe we need new standards legislation in this area to form the basis for a single European agreement based on the same software and hardware platforms.
Secondly, GPS has brought us new opportunities in navigation.
Not too long ago I was in Moscow where we will be getting another system in the form of GLONASS.
This heralds the start of a new era in navigation.
To what extent will this new agency's remit include setting safety standards for future projects?
