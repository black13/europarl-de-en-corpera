I was the rapporteur on enlargement in Eastern Europe and internal security.
What we are currently seeing is that, due to the large privatization programme, coupled with uncertainties in terms of law and order, large scale money laundering is going on in countries wishing to accede to the Union, in some cases the laundering of money which comes from the European Union and is then transferred back to it.
Does the question of money laundering have a role to play in the structured dialogue with the countries of central and eastern Europe and in the preparations for accession?
This issue was introduced into my report by Mr Schmid of the Social Democrats.
Countries wishing to accede to the Union must take energetic measures to counter money laundering prior to accession.
