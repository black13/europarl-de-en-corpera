Mr President, the discovery that, given the same level of growth, the United States creates more jobs than Europe, either with a higher or a lower net product, is fundamental.
With unemployment of 18 million a direct relationship must be established between competitiveness and job creation.
A competitive industry simply creates more jobs.
The field in which Europe, both at Community and national level, has a genuine need to catch up, is industrial research.
Our efforts must be concentrated much more on commercial realizability.
Due to flaws in the coordination of research policies in the Member States, some of the most valuable synergy effects are lost.
Particularly in the area of information technology, a research and development policy with excellent coordination and funding could make a significant contribution towards improving the competitiveness of European industry.
