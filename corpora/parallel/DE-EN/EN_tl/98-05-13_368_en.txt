Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is not long - only about 5 or 10 years - since the people of Europe would not have understood the term "Internet' .
If we look at developments which have taken place since then we see that we are in fact eye witnesses of a revolution in the field of data exchange and are therefore experiencing a revolution of our society and of human coexistence.
However, I would venture to say that we are only at the beginning of a very complex transformation process.
Gradually we notice more and more new fields of application for telecommunications.
I published a book on this subject in the spring of this year and when I read it again today I see that some parts of the book are already out of date.
I believe that we must overcome these ever-recurring obstacles and changes.
For this reason I am grateful for the Communication of the Commission and for the extraordinary commitment of the rapporteur, Erika Mann, and also of Wim van Velzen for a European initiative in electronic business transactions.
The Internet is therefore no longer only suitable for data exchange and transmission of information but also for modern business developments and in fact for conducting business simply, cheaply and quickly.
This means that excellent opportunities in general, as well as possibilities for employment, are opened up to consumers and to many small and medium-sized enterprises.
These new opportunities in turn create completely new service opportunities.
Thus I support the aim of keeping electronic commerce in a European context and preventing the fragmentation of the Internal Market.
We want international agreements and coordination.
