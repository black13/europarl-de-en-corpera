Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, technical standards and regulations are an extremely important instrument of economic policy.
Their function is to create transparency and promote communication.
I would like to distinguish between two levels: the horizontal level, which involves activities in the Member States, and the second, European, level.
It seems to me quite important to include in these considerations those countries which seek accession and finally also to initiate communication with "the rest of the world' .
The vertical level is also very important.
I believe that by means of harmonization we have achieved a certain degree of progress on the vertical level, but also that the system of mutual recognition has also brought with it many advantages.
A third level, the duty of provision of information, can also provide a basis for the free movement of goods.
I wonder if it would not be advantageous to allow these systems to exist side by side.
For us it is important that the market can react quickly and at a low cost.
The question is how we in Europe can support the formulation of standards.
I believe it would be useful to set up a task force for these new regulations.
Something could also be done within the Framework Programme on Research and Development in order to be able to take any emerging developments into account in advance.
For this we need infrastructure, although it may be possible to merely reorganize existing infrastructure, and of course we also need education.
