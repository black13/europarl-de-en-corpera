Mr President, I voted for Mrs Randzio-Plath's recommendation on the appointment of the six candidates for the Central Bank's Executive Board.
However, I have no wish to conceal the fact that considerable doubts have arisen as to the regularity of the voting procedure.
Of course, we could ask which high ranking politicians - Mr Chirac or Mr Kohl, perhaps - or which second-string politicians, Mr Waigel or individuals such as Mr Tietmeyer, for example, are responsible for the procedure.
In my view, however, the most important issue is to recognize that the provisions of this section of the Maastricht Treaty need to be changed.
I would make the following plea to the Council, and in particular to the forthcoming German Presidency of the Council.
If in the future we want the citizens of Europe to regard the euro as a reliable and stable currency, then the individuals serving in this Central Bank must also have been elected by a procedure in which the citizens can have the greatest confidence.
This means, firstly, that we must move away from the requirement of unanimity.
It is unacceptable that a Member State should be able to delay approval of a decision on the question of who should be proposed by the Council until the end of an extremely boring lunch, as was recently the case.
Secondly, it must be made quite clear that the European Parliament is doing more than making a simple recommendation.
In the future, the European Parliament must be able to elect these candidates in the same way as the Council, that is by a majority.
These candidates will then also enjoy the confidence of the general public.
