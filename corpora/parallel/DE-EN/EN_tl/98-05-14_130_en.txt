Madam President, I first wish to thank all the people whose support has led to the adoption of this joint resolution, and also the operators of the Mochovce nuclear plant and all those NGOs which were prepared to provide us with comprehensive information in this field.
Of course it is the right of every sovereign state to make its own decisions on the use of its primary energy sources, but in recent years, and certainly since Chernobyl, we have come to realize that we are all nextdoor neighbours when it comes to the nuclear plants of Europe.
It is the right of every neighbour, in the face of such potentially dangerous technology, to demand the application of those safety standards which are taken for granted in Germany, France and the UK.
This is all part of the acquis communautaire .
Without adherence to the strictest possible safety standards there can be no talk of accession to the European Union.
Two international panels of experts have visited the Mochovce plant in recent weeks.
It was taken for granted that the start-up of the plant would await the outcome of these investigations and any identified defects would be put right beforehand.
But no, the operators announced to an astonished public that whatever happened, they intended to commence operating trials on 21 July.
This is something we cannot accept.
We are also still owed an answer as to the nuclear waste, for this material certainly cannot be sold to Russia.
The law is absolutely stringent on this.
Neither Austria nor the EU can force Slovakia or any other country to collaborate with us, but compliance with the findings of the two panels could constitute the starting point for creating international structures for greater transparency in nuclear matters, and for this Slovakia would earn the gratitude not only of Austria but of the whole European Union.
