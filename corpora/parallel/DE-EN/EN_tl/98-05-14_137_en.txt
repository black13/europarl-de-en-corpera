Madam President, the start-up of the Mochovce nuclear reactor is a decision which will have farreaching consequences for the entire future of nuclear power generation.
This reactor would never have been approved as safe either by an EU Member State or in the USA.
The nuclear industry is placing its high-risk installations right up against the borders of the EU.
This is a cynical gesture to the safety of the whole of Europe.
Added to this is the fact that we are for the first time faced with a situation in which the start-up of a suspect nuclear plant may well be part of an election strategy.
The Slovak Prime Minister, Vladimir Meciar, is keen to show the world that he heads a determined and strong government, prior to the autumn ballot.
The nuclear plant is to go into operation in spite of the fact that internationally recognized experts consider that building a new installation would be more cost-efficient that refitting an old one to meet international safety standards.
A panel of experts has recently examined the plant and their findings are to be made known shortly.
I propose that the European Parliament should invite these experts to a hearing on safety standards at the plant.
Slovakia does not have a credible energy policy.
I recall that the Slovak government originally promised that the start-up of Mochovce would be accompanied by the closure of the two unsafe units at Bohunice.
This was also the basis on which the German-based Hermes Bank provided a credit guarantee for Siemens-KWU to supply equipment for the start-up of the Mochovce plant.
Contrary to all promises, Bohunice is being refitted, rather than closed, at a cost of over ECU 150 million.
Slovakia recently declared that Bohunice would be put into service along with the start-up of Mochovce.
The European Parliament and the Hermes Bank have clearly been deceived.
In view of these events the resolution in question is very restrained, but it can be accepted as a minimum response to the situation.
