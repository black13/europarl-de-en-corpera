Madam President, the authorities and the military in Guatemala should take responsibility for the serious and systematic infringement of human rights in that country.
This was one of the main aims of the thousand-page REMHI report which was prepared under the direction of Bishop Juan Gerardi.
As the latter said in one of his last interviews, this will not suit a lot of the people who are seeking to make a clean break with the past.
Bishop Gerardi's brutal murder took place against a background of continuing impunity.
Neither the armed forces nor the secret services have been exculpated as a consequence of the peace treaties.
The report finally names the people responsible and calls for action to be taken.
This includes the immediate disbandment of the military and civilian instruments of repression, the prosecution of paramilitary groups, an end to impunity and compensation for the victims.
REMHI restores the dignity of the people.
Project collaborators must be given protection, and this includes those working up-country.
Europe supports many projects in Guatemala, including the build-up of new security forces.
Here it is essential for the EU to ensure that no support whatsoever is given to human rights violators of the old guard.
We should back the establishment of an international commission to investigate properly the fate of the people who have disappeared.
