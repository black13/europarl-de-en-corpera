Madam President, we all sympathize with the death of Bishop Gerardi, which has been a grave loss for the people of Guatemala.
I believe, however, that even at a moment such as this we should be focusing on the fact that his work must go on.
But international intervention certainly produces no results.
The Guatemalan government has recently shown how anxious it is to establish peace and order.
After 30 years of civil war, however, it is simply inconceivable that such a thing can be achieved overnight.
However, given my experience of the Guatemalan people, which certainly does not compare with that of my friend Mr Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler, I continue to fear that if we intervene too vigorously they will do just the opposite of what we wish.
Nevertheless, we should make every possible effort to administer the legacy of Bishop Gerardi, and do everything we can to achieve his aims.
