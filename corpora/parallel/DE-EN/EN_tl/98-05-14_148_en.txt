Madam President, the murder of Eduardo Uma√±a Mendoza has shocked us all.
This sudden, politically motivated crime is the worst attack to date on the human rights movement and on all the opposition groups in Colombia.
This lawyer of many years' standing was known to some of us personally.
He was even told that the recent cases he had been working on would cost him his life, for as Colombia's most distinguished lawyer he had for 20 years consistently and uncompromisingly represented the victims of human rights violations.
It is an open secret as to which of the state and military forces were behind this murder.
Furthermore, those who are promoting economic cooperation with Colombia and granting customs waivers through the GSP are accessories to a terrible spiral of violence which continues to be fuelled by those who benefit from it.
Only yesterday afternoon some 30 soldiers with search warrants forced their way into the offices belonging to Justicia y Paz and other human rights organizations, allegedly in the hunt for would-be assassins.
Such intimidation of human rights supporters is completely unacceptable, and the Council should distance itself unequivocally from such a policy.
The Commission must review the terms of its entire policy of cooperation with Colombia, otherwise the people fighting for human rights in Colombia will soon not just be muzzled but murdered!
Commissioner, I would be pleased if you could for once give us answers to some of these questions.
I know you are a master of diplomacy, but a response would be most appropriate in this case.
