Madam President, like the previous speaker, I can only point out that yet again we have to draw attention to the atrocities - and how often have we already condemned such actions? - which are being committed primarily in Colombia, which, one regrets to have to say, is a land of violence.
Eduardo Umaña Mendoza is the third human rights activist to be killed in a very short space of time.
We really must demand that these human rights representatives are given better protection as they go about their work.
The government is clearly unable to take decisive action, but violence is not the solution - certainly not for the people of the country, who have suffered most from it.
Colombia can to all intents and purposes now be considered as a country where violence prevails and its citizens can do nothing about it.
Nor will the elections of 31 May bring an end to the killings, as indicated by the murder of the former General Fernando Landazabal, who was advising presidential candidate Andrés Pastrana on various matters, including a future peace plan.
Other candidates' names are also on the death lists, and this includes people on both sides.
This is no way to achieve democracy.
This is no solution.
We call upon the government authorities, the candidates and all the parties to come to a peaceful political solution and at long last to bring democracy and peace to the people of Colombia.
