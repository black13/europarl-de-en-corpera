Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the reason for today's debate and resolution is the conviction of a number of politicians who were members of the former Refah Party.
It is bad enough for a country to think that it has to conduct its political arguments in a court of law, that political arguments with Islam, political Islam, fundamentalist Islam, have to be conducted in court and by application of court judgments.
But what is even worse is that something even more inconceivable has now taken place with the attempt on the life of Akin Birdal.
As has already been said by a number of speakers, Akin Birdal was, and is - and it is hoped will remain - a champion, an indefatigable and fearless champion of human rights, both in Turkey and elsewhere, because of the shining example he has set.
He never gave up the fight for human rights, even though he knew and felt that something such as this could happen to him.
That is why we are making a common appeal to Turkey.
Turkey wants to join the European Union, and it could well be that there were a few hitches - and in my view there certainly were - in the talks which were held primarily with the Council last autumn.
Nevertheless, the pure and simple fact remains that we can only accept Turkey into the EU when it decides to uphold human rights, among many other things.
Turkey must take note of one thing: upholding human rights also means protecting those who speak up for human rights and protecting those who fight for human rights.
I am convinced - for I am an optimist - that no-one in the government and no-one in the military was happy to hear of this attempt on Mr Birdal's life.
But that is not enough.
What Turkey should be doing, instead of just being "not happy' about it, is taking every possible measure to prevent such outrages.
That is what we need to see before we can welcome Turkey as a member of the European Union.
The Turkish government must be absolutely clear about that.
