Mr President, the European Commission, when looking into alliances between airlines, should not lose sight of the global competitiveness of these European companies.
Strategic alliances are now of fundamental importance in strengthening the international competitiveness of the European air travel sector.
Our airlines should therefore be supported by their own authorities when going through the process of restructuring.
Unfortunately, support of this kind is rarely forthcoming and instead highly expensive conditions are imposed on airlines for the licensing of alliances - such as the withdrawal of slots and flight traffic restrictions.
The Commission should only intervene when a violation of competition law has actually occurred.
Its competition policy should not involve measures which will only handicap the European air travel industry and jeopardize the future of European airlines, particularly the smaller companies.
