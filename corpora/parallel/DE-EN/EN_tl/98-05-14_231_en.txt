Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it used to be when you wanted to travel somewhere that you would go and stand at a counter.
You then had to wade through piles of brochures, a process which could often be complicated and not always successful, before you got to your destination.
The computer has now taken over this work and has made the whole thing much less complicated.
This new technology now gives us access to an unwonted supply of information and a wide range of choices, and what is more, at very competitive prices.
As such, it has been very well received by the consumer.
Now that the computer is with us, we really must stop hoping and believing that the computer is always an objective thing.
On the contrary, the computer is a real box of tricks and there are now many thousands of people whose only job is to manipulate the computer to suit one supplier or another.
The airlines, and even the travel agents, have tried to give customers the illusion of objectivity, while all the time they were only looking to increase profits.
While there is of course nothing wrong with wanting to make a profit, this has done very little for the consumer.
The proposals before us, including those of Mr van Dam, are very sensible and will lead to better consumer protection.
I also see that we need this interconnection when it comes to the modal split with rail transport, so that at the push of a button the traveller knows which system is better, which is cheaper and, furthermore, which is more environmentally friendly.
I believe that Members of this Parliament will also benefit from this, but that is just by the by.
One final point: the review of these systems is not something which will be finished and done with today.
It will have to be repeated at regular intervals, because you can be absolutely sure that there will always be someone in the know trying to get round the regulations.
