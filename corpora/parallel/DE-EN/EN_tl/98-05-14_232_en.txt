Mr President, I shall try to be brief.
The important thing is really to thank the rapporteur, for he has submitted an excellent report which has been unanimously approved in committee.
With quite a few countries in the middle of election campaigns, it is always very nice to be able to say that a report has been carried unanimously because of its absolute objectivity.
Thank you very much, Mr van Dam, for this report.
Reform of the code of conduct is very sensible, and it will increase the objectivity of the information provided.
The most important thing now is to include high speed trains in this system, so that people are better able to recognize those routes where it is more practical to take the train than to fly.
This is something we want to see for shorter trips - in other words, more journeys by train than by aeroplane - in order to decongest air space and preserve the environment.
In this respect the advantages are enormous.
Unlike the Commission, I consider the display of code share flights to be a sensible move.
Here I agree with the rapporteur.
This system has proved to be very effective.
Finally, I think it is right to produce a consolidated version of the three pieces of legislation, so they can be more clearly understood by consumers.
In this respect, codification is something the Commission should be following up.
I believe we can reach a consensus here: we have a good proposal and this is now to be improved upon by Mr van Dam.
I hope the Commission accepts the rapporteur's proposals and then everyone will be happy.
