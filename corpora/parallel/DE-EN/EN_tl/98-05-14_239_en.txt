Madam President, Commissioner and those ladies and gentlemen who have remained patiently with us, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has already said something about the decision making side of things.
I would like to restrict myself to the subject of seed and seed marketing.
As we all know, seed is an important resource for agriculture and it is also the basis for foodstuff production.
The provision of good seed is ultimately a prerequisite for a secure nutrition system.
What is more, the quality of the seed has a decisive effect - a very decisive effect - on the quality of the food produced, in many cases even regardless of the various processing stages.
For these reasons, the inspection of plant and seed stocks naturally assumes great importance.
Most countries today are accustomed to having their seed crop certified mainly by public bodies.
However, such a system has made the inspection process somewhat more cumbersome.
Against such a background, the Commission has now submitted its proposal for the simplification of this inspection process.
There is already a substantial need to create a greater sense of responsibility in this sector.
Seed breeders and cultivators have to be incorporated more closely into the seed recognition procedure.
Simplification in this area is indeed desirable and would also mean that unofficial inspectors could carry out the prescribed examinations.
Here the spotlight will naturally fall on the employees of seed producing companies, as Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has repeatedly pointed out.
These people, with their knowledge and experience, are absolutely made for the job of seed inspection.
Admittedly there is a risk that this will lead to conflicts of interest, and this is something which we shall have to counteract.
On the whole we in the Group of the European People's Party can accept this report, retaining as it does the necessary amendments.
Thank you very much, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, especially for your pertinacity.
