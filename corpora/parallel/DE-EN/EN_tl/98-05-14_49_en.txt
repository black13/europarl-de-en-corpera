Mr President, the rapporteur correctly points out that the EU's information and communication policy should be made more efficient.
But what does he mean by this?
He comes to the conclusion that by increasing efficiency in this area we would be able to dispel the negative climate of opinion surrounding the EU, and consequently force the pace of European integration.
I do not share this view.
The widening gulf between the citizens of Europe and its institutions is not being caused by the inadequate information policy but by the unsatisfactory answers which have been given to Europe's most burning questions, such as that of the 18 million unemployed.
While the rapporteur stresses the multilingual talents of the people of Europe, the Committee on Institutional Affairs is already discussing the future adoption of Esperanto as a common European language.
While the rapporteur stresses the importance of the moving picture, Members of this House are proposing that the cameras be removed from the Chamber.
While the rapporteur underlines the importance of intelligibility in the drawing up of legal documents, Members are declaring that they are unable to understand the language of the regulations which have been submitted on agricultural reform.
As these examples show, the claims which have been made simply do not live up to reality.
Pretty wrapping paper is not enough - the contents of the package must also be right.
If the communication policy of the institutions is to be regarded...
