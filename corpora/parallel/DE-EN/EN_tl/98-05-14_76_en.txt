I should just like to point out that no new information whatsoever has been forthcoming since yesterday.
We already knew by midday yesterday that Mr Rugova and Mr Milosevic intend to meet tomorrow.
More than this we do not know.
We therefore have nothing new to add.
We hope this discussion can commence without any preconditions, as stated in the resolution.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
