Madam President, I am presenting this explanation of vote on behalf of my Group, namely the Green Group in the European Parliament.
It relates to a report which has produced a fundamental change in the policy of this House.
The Green Group, like a few other groups in this Parliament, belongs to that section of the House which does not consider it necessary to be armed to the teeth in order to achieve a democratic, ecological and socially just European Union.
In this respect, we condemn the fact that in spite of massive protests by a minority in this House during the ratification process for the Amsterdam Treaty, and despite the fact that some Member States of this European Union are neutral, such a report was put on the agenda.
The result is that this initiative by the European Parliament anticipates matters which go much further than the Amsterdam Treaty and therefore will severely disrupt the ratification process in the neutral states.
Most importantly of all, it will certainly not be in the interests of freedom of choice for the citizens of Europe.
We were given no mandate from the people to do this.
In the midst of all this confusion a serious change has taken place.
At the conclusion it was not made clear that the name of our committee, the "Subcommittee on Security and Disarmament' , has been changed to the "Subcommittee on Security and Defence' .
This too goes far beyond the Amsterdam Treaty.
On behalf of the Green Group, I wish to register a strong protest against the attempts which are being made to change the procedures in the European Union by way of initiatives, and to do this against the will of the European people.
