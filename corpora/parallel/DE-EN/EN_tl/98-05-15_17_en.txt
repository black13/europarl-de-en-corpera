Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following the sign against crime campaign when we dealt with crime in Brussels, today we come to the "vote against crime' .
We would like to give our full support to Mr Schmid's report.
I think that it is urgently necessary to proceed consistently against organized crime.
Indeed, we ought also to have had a debate here this week, which has had to be postponed because of the urgency of another topic.
I am confident that we shall be able to have this debate with the Council and the Commission in our next Strasbourg sitting.
In Germany we have heard that gangs of children were shipped into Germany from Romania with the job of picking pockets.
If they had not picked a certain number of pockets by the evening, their lips were burnt with cigarettes or their lower legs were slashed with razor blades.
The organizers were caught in this case.
We can see that our cities face entirely new dangers in the area of crime.
Credit cards were also stolen in the course of these pickpocketing incidents, and were used for fraud, with enormous sums being lost.
This is quite unacceptable to us.
That is why I have made the proposal - and anyone who travels can see this in the ASEAN countries for example - that like the German railway pass, credit cards should automatically incorporate photos of the credit card owner, so that you can immediately tell whether the person in question really is the owner of the card.
These cards should also perhaps incorporate a fingerprint so that trained personnel could quickly identify, alongside the signature, whether a credit card was being presented by the legal owner.
