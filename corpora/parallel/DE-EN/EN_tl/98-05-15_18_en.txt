Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are two reasons why the Commission welcomes today's debate on Mr Schmid's report.
Firstly, it is important that the European Parliament should be able to express its views in matters of cooperation in the fields of justice and home affairs before the Treaty of Amsterdam comes into effect.
Secondly, by virtue of their quality, Mr Schmid's report and the amendments it contains should give the Council cause to consider it carefully.
In short, the Commission welcomes this proposal for a joint action.
It should be seen as a practical instrument which facilitates the work of all those who deal with investigations in connection with payment card fraud, and one which respects privacy and human rights.
We are particularly pleased that this initiative is based on a project that was financed with budgetary funds from the European Union, or, to be more precise, with funds which Parliament and the Council made available to assist initiatives in the fields of justice and home affairs.
In addition, I should also like to point out that this initiative should be regarded as a concrete measure to implement the European Union's action plan to fight organized crime, which has been extensively discussed in this House.
At present, the Commission is concluding its considerations in connection with the task with which it was entrusted in the context of the action plan, of elaborating proposals for measures against fraud and against the forgery of all types of means of payment, including credit cards, and of examining inter alia the introduction of harmonized bases for punishable offences in relation to certain actions.
All these initiatives, among which we should also include the entry into force of the Europol agreement which is expected this year, and which will mean that Europol is at last fully able to act, show that the European Union intends to proceed with determination against criminal wheeling and dealing in the area of the European Union.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
