Mr President, I shall deal first of all with the question raised by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf.
A definitive decision is currently being taken in this multi-disciplinary working group about all the subjects which can and should be dealt with.
The list of subjects is already extensive.
The identification of the factors involved in anti-microbial resistance is one of the questions which needs to be clarified.
It would be entirely appropriate to deal with your concern under this item.
I shall pass the point on to the relevant units in DG XXIV.
Secondly, our aim is not to have the European Court of Justice decide; rather, we want to have both the Swedish and the Finnish application evaluated by scientists in the first instance.
We should not pre-empt the result but wait to see what result emerges from this scientific evaluation.
Now, I will consider the question from Mr Olsson.
I do not believe that this is really a matter in which research is necessary.
I believe that there is already a great deal of knowledge in relation to the conditions under which animals are kept.
It is more a matter of creating an economic environment which makes it possible for farmers to put these animal-friendly rearing methods into practice.
In my view, the truth is that the more species-appropriate a system of animal rearing, the lower the vets' bills are, although there are higher investment costs to be faced.
If we therefore provide for greater assistance to these methods of rearing compared with other methods in the context of our new Agenda, the incentive to switch to such methods will be greater.
However, insofar as additional research is necessary within the framework of the current research programmes, if appropriate projects are submitted by the Member States and by the different research bodies, there is, of course, nothing to prevent further investigations being carried out.
