Mr President, we should undoubtedly acknowledge that certain objectives which are listed in this balanced report have been achieved without major additional expenditure being incurred by the Community.
I should like to emphasize the fact that, in this case, the Community has made a welcome contribution to integrating agriculture in the new LÃ¤nder into the structures of the common agricultural policy.
The fact that the Community has shared in the costs of re-structuring the economy of the GDR and has provided proof of its solidarity with the people of the GDR in this way is very much to be welcomed.
It is all the more regrettable that the report by the Court of Auditors also indicates certain tendencies towards mismanagement on the part of the Commission in this very delicate area.
In addition to considerable delays in controls and wrongly paid subsidies, individual assistance programmes were not even properly coordinated with one another.
The Court of Auditors thus complains in its report that farmers could have claimed three different subsidies for the slaughter of one of their animals, which would have made multiple payments possible.
Such cumulations of subsidies must be avoided at all costs in the future, particularly bearing in mind the massive organizational challenges which the Union will have to face in the near future.
How can citizens in the Member States otherwise be expected to gain confidence in the European Union in the face of the serious shortcomings that constantly occur?
