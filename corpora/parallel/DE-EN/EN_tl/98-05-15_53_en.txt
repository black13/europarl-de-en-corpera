Mr President, my group also very much welcomes the Commission's intention to provide greater assistance to combined heat and power.
The technology has, after all, long been well known, although for a long time it was deployed only as emergency unit technology in hospitals etcetera.
Far too little use has been made of it in the area of town planning and local authority development plans, and in this context it still runs up against obstacles because of certain minimum running times.
However, the advantages are obvious.
Alongside the necessary demand for renewable energy, this is a very good contribution towards the better achievement of Kyoto's political energy targets.
It has rightly been said that combined heat and power is sensible because it leads to better utilization of primary energy and to a reduction in atmospheric pollution.
Above all, it offers interesting new possibilities for combination with bio-mass utilization in agriculture and industry, and particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises.
It holds out very interesting prospects of reducing the burden of energy costs on small and medium-sized enterprises and of contributing towards self-sufficiency in energy supply in Third World countries as well.
I should also like to stress that there are very interesting models for the better use of agricultural waste, mainly in winegrowing, in a combined technology of bio-mass utilization and combined heat and power.
I am glad that it has now been possible to reach agreement on the fact that the operators of CHP plants will be recognized as qualified generators of electricity.
I must say to my colleagues in the PPE that I regret the fact that you rejected such recognition a little while ago in the case of the gas directive when it was a question of putting it on a proper legal basis.
