Mr President, we have reached the end of a century in which we have squandered more energy resources than in the entire previous history of mankind.
War has been waged, and is still waged over these resources.
Even today there can be no mistaking the consequences for the environment.
It is high time that we radically re-structured our entire energy system.
Success in this endeavour will assuredly be one of the central issues for the next century.
At present Europe is dependent on other countries for 50 % of its energy, a state of affairs which presents a problem not only in ecological and social terms, but also in terms of peace policy.
That is why the development of combined heat and power systems is an essential step in the right direction towards energy self-sufficiency in the European Union.
However, the efficiency of these measures in terms of energy policy will become really effective only if importance is attached in this development to giving priority to renewable sources of energy over fossil fuels, with the eventual aim of full substitution.
This would have to be guaranteed above all by fiscal incentives and fair access to the electricity market.
