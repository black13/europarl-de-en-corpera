Amendment No 1, which has been approved and tabled by the Committee on Agriculture and Amendment No 5 from Mr Fantuzzi contradict each other; they are not compatible.
I prefer Amendment No 1 which was adopted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
The Commission has indicated that although it could live with both of them, if I have understood matters correctly, the amendments are incompatible and cannot be supplemented either.
So we have to make up our minds, and I am in favour of Amendment No 1.
