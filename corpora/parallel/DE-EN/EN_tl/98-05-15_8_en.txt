Mr President, before the vote on the legislative resolution I should just like to confirm again that the changes which the Commission has made to Amendments Nos 2 and 3 are of an editorial nature rather than a substantive one - insofar as an amendment represents a supplement to the existing legal text - in other words, that these changes are in accordance with what we are voting on here, so that we shall then have a common position from Parliament and the Commission.
If you nod now, we can vote!
