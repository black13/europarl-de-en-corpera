Mr President, my point was not to refute what the President said this morning; my point was that I expected a political reaction.
That is what I am criticising.
Of course it is only a provisional report.
Of course it was distributed to the Chairmen of the groups much too late, and of course as a Member I also received it yesterday evening.
That's not my point!
My point is that I am pressing for a political reaction from our President, given that the press out there which is full of suppositions and insinuations is demanding answers which have to be given by every Member of this House.
My criticism was a political one, it was not aimed at the formalities and the Rules of Procedure!
In that respect, the President is certainly right!
