Mr President, many thanks for listening to my important remarks so late in the day.
Guarantees of quality should certainly be welcomed.
We should also welcome efforts to align quality in Europe.
However, what has not been taken into account is the free access that we are addressing.
Free access for students to all of Europe's colleges and universities will result in a hierarchy of higher education institutions, and will generate a competition which leads to efforts being made by all colleges and universities to attract students.
That will be far more important than provisions aimed at aligning them with each other.
However, the concept that has been mentioned of research training is somewhat questionable because research training would mean that special syllabuses would have to be developed for research.
Secondly, what is missing here is the propagation of co-operation between research and industry, because we know from experience that research only works properly where it is jointly organized with industry.
