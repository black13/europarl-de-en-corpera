Mr President, in the short period of six months it is hardly possible for a Council Presidency to have a strong impact on the European political process.
That is why continuity and cooperation between successive presidencies are all the more important.
However, our citizens are given the impression, conveyed in part by national media, that each Presidency functions in historical isolation.
Every six months Europe is invented anew, so to speak.
My question to the British Council Presidency, therefore, as an Austrian Opposition politician, is this: in July, do the Austrians start again from scratch, as seems to be the case, or is there genuine co-operation between the British Presidency and the future Austrian Presidency which will ensure that processes already begun will continue to run smoothly?
If the answer is yes, in which areas is there agreement, and where can Austria build on preparatory work by Britain?
