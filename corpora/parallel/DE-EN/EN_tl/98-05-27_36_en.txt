Mr President, during this discussion, as the Chairman of the Catholic Workers' Movement in the Regensburg Diocese, I have found myself thinking of something that Cardinal Cardyns said: every single young worker is worth more than all the gold in the world.
This is an old saying, but its message is still relevant.
Jobs are important, but hitherto there has been too much talk, and here I would agree with my colleague Wim van Velzen, and not enough success.
Now there are action plans.
I only hope that they will be implemented quickly and successfully, otherwise even the best action plans will be of no use.
Best practice is fine, but I hope that it is quickly adopted in those countries which have not hitherto adopted it.
We are always hearing about assistance to SMEs but no Council Presidency and no Commission has yet been able to ensure that small and medium-sized enterprises have simple requirements so that they, too, can put them into practice.
Taxation and welfare systems should bring about a reduction in accessory costs to wages, but they must also be fair so that employees do not again bear the burdens alone.
Structural reform, Agenda 2000 - Commissioner Santer, rural areas seem to me to have been treated very shabbily in this goulash Objective II.
Something more has to be done in this area.
As regards the environment, allow me to say that we need both people and nature, and not nature without people!
I also have a question about the operation of the own resources system: why do we have no money for computers when at the same time we are giving away billions of marks in own resources?
Perhaps for once you could do something about this.
Please implement the social market economy as quickly as possible in the new accession countries so that we are not confronted there by problems which are the same as our own.
Do not forget subsidiarity even if as a central government you sometimes are not so happy about it!
