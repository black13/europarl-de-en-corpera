Mr President, first of all I should like to thank the rapporteur sincerely for the work which he has presented to us.
I would like to deal with two items, both from the viewpoint of my group and from the viewpoint of the Committee on Development and Co-operation.
We are talking about a common security and foreign policy.
The question arises in this context of how we should deal with conflicts.
The rapporteur stressed this in his report, but it continues to be the case that we come up against unpleasant surprises in this area.
We have already invoked conflict prevention several times, and I would like to acknowledge in this context that we have now arrived at a code of conduct for the arms trade.
We shall need to examine the document carefully as well, although we should not overlook the fact that none of this will have any effect on the illegal arms trade - which continues to be our major problem.
It has been a source of some regret to me that the Council Presidency has not now dealt with some points in the report which are essential in my view.
In the interests of brevity, I shall do no more than quote the numbers, namely paragraphs 10, 14, 15 and 17: these are the questions that need to be addressed.
Although the Council Presidency has said it is a matter for Member States, and has passed the buck, it would have been interesting to hear whether there are any approaches which it would be worth pursuing.
There is one more point that I would like to mention, namely the question of the human rights clause which is to be incorporated into treaties with third countries, a demand which has in fact largely been realized in the development sphere, and for which the legal bases have also been created.
This shows that foreign policy can sometimes learn a thing or two from development policy.
