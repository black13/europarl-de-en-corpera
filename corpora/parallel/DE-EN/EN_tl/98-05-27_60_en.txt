Mr President, unfortunately the European Union's common foreign and security policy continues to be more a matter of wishful thinking than a reality.
That is why the Spencer report is quite right to stress that the public has not been given the impression of progress in the development of a European foreign policy.
The lack of an inter-institutional agreement on the right of the Parliament to be informed and consulted is also a weakness.
We can only observe with regret that there continues to be a mismatch between the EU's foreign policy and its trade policy activities.
Given the major foreign policy challenges of the European Union resulting from the enlargement process, the citizens of Europe must be allowed to participate in this process through the involvement of the European Parliament, not in order to throw a spanner in the works but to strengthen the acceptance of enlargement in Europe.
The European Union will be tested repeatedly against the yardstick of its ability to act in foreign policy matters.
It is important for the EU not only to speak politically with one voice but also to have available the necessary security policy instruments in order to take peace-keeping or peace-making measures, for the purposes of crisis prevention, whether it be in Albania or Kosovo.
The deteriorating situation in Kosovo is a priority for Austria as the next Council Presidency but as long as the political will is lacking to exercise real influence here, all initiatives threaten to become a demonstration of impotence, and the European Union runs the risk - as has already happened in the Balkans - of becoming an onlooker at an uncontrollable development and of letting slip the need to act.
