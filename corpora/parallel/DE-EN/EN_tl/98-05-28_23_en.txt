Mr President, in his report Mr Ca√±ete has very carefully evaluated how the Cohesion Fund was implemented for the 1996 financial year.
There is no denying the success of the Cohesion Fund.
Infrastructure has been decisively improved.
As far as the environment is concerned, financing has continued to concentrate on water supply and treatment projects and, to a lesser extent, on waste treatment.
The essential purpose of the Cohesion Fund, namely to promote economic and social cohesion, has so far been achieved, as witnessed by the increase in per capita income over the last ten years.
This is borne out by the fact that Ireland, Portugal and Spain are to join monetary union in the first wave, while Greece is also well on its way to joining.
That is all I have to say regarding the annual report for 1996 and its evaluation.
In some aspects of the resolution the rapporteur has tried - although in my opinion this was not part of his remit - to keep all four current beneficiary Member States in the Cohesion Fund beyond the year 1999.
Regrettably, I cannot agree to this.
Solidarity also means not demanding or approving any more aid than is absolutely necessary.
