Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today's debate is not a fundamental discussion on whether or not to retain the Cohesion Fund beyond 1999.
Mr Ca√±ete's report, which in itself was a very good piece of work, is the 1996 annual review of the Commission's report for this period.
This means that it should be, and indeed is, an analysis and critical assessment of the latter, combined with relevant conclusions on the efficient use of funds in both qualitative and quantitative terms.
Let us then not anticipate the revision of the Structural Funds and the review of the Cohesion Funds, which will surely go hand in hand with it.
This 1996 report is not the appropriate place for such deliberations.
The amendment which we have proposed, and which was tabled on behalf of my group, can really only be understood from this perspective.
I therefore also reject the comment which Mr Novo made some while ago as completely unjustified.
What now appears in these clauses goes well beyond the limits of a 1996 report and should be presented at some later date, not as part of this report.
I am of the opinion, however, that with the rapporteur we have found acceptable solutions to this problem.
