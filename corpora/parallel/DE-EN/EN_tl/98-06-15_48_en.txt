Mr President, I too wish to thank the rapporteur very warmly for her work, and as she described the whole legal background for us with her usual clarity I would now like to go into some political aspects of this procedure in the two minutes I have available.
It has become a tradition in the European Parliament that we ask our partners in development cooperation: "How do you deal with human rights?
How do you manage the running of the state effectively, in terms of good governance?
How do you ensure legal certainty for your citizens in the legal system?'
I believe we must not limit the discussion to the area of human rights alone.
We must always bear in mind the other two areas as well.
Of course, one is not necessarily conceivable without the other, but from that point of view we have actually always adopted this joint approach in discussions.
With this procedure - if we implement it in the way the rapporteur described - we have clear legal certainty for the ACP partner countries and beyond, as we are in the process of extending our cooperation to include to a greater extent the least developed countries which do not belong to the ACP.
Some parts of this procedure could therefore be applied here.
It is sometimes noticeable that when human rights violations, bad administration and corrupt government persist for a long time, the stringency with which such sanctions are applied occasionally diminishes to some extent.
I believe we should agree to proceed with equal intensity wherever we observe such shortcomings, and must continue to do so resolutely until the situation improves.
