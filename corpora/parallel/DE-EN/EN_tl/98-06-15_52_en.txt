Mr President, we support this request and particularly the idea behind it, although in our opinion it does not go far enough.
A consultation procedure is certainly necessary; an assent procedure would be the better solution.
We wish to announce one thing now: if there should be no solution during the British presidency, we will try to persuade the Austrian Government that this topic should be accorded particular importance after the change of presidency.
I also have a few general comments on this very important issue.
On the basis of its own history, Europe should proceed with great caution in the field of human rights.
If Parliament succeeds in dealing with this problem itself, every care will have to be taken and we will have to ensure that we are not tempted to make generalized premature judgements.
The fact that we are becoming active in this area is to be welcomed, but each individual case must be examined closely.
The relevant countries, which are grouped together here, are at very different stages of economic development.
A measure may affect one country very severely and another less so.
The list of human rights which are constantly mentioned does not include, for example, the right to food and education, a right which is threatened when cooperation is terminated due to a lack of democratic development.
One thing we must bear in mind is that our role is not to act as judge, but to promote and support democratic development in the individual countries.
