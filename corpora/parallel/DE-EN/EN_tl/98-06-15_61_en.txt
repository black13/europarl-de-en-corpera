Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too wish to thank the rapporteur for the work he has done.
There is no doubt that great dangers are associated with genetic engineering and biotechnology.
We have often discussed these dangers here, for example in relation to the cloning of human beings.
As a further example, I am concerned that the application of prenatal diagnosis will lead to the selection of disabled persons.
This is a danger which we must recognize.
The current proposal for a regulation concerns an application of genetic engineering which, in my view, is associated with great opportunities and regarding which, after twenty years of use, the dangers perhaps envisaged some years ago have not in fact materialized.
So far there have not been any unforeseen incidents.
For this reason, I believe it makes sense to remove this directive from the realm of bureaucracy.
Europe must not fall any further behind in the production of medicines using genetically modified micro-organisms.
We must catch up, and for this we need fewer bureaucratic rules.
This does not mean any less security as we have a differentiated approach here.
The micro-organisms which are potentially dangerous, as Mr Bowe said, continue to be treated with extreme caution.
Harmless micro-organisms, however, must be treated with less caution as the danger does not lie in the fact that we are dealing with genetic engineering but in the microorganisms themselves.
That is why I have spoken out emphatically against some of the amendments to the report, which did not come from Mr Trakatellis but were voted into the report, that is Amendments Nos 2, 4, 9 and 14.
As far as liability is concerned, I also do not believe we need a particularly strict regulation for biotechnology.
We need a comprehensive regulation, which the Commission is currently preparing.
But we cannot always apply restrictions in the area of biotechnology or we will never be able to catch up in this area.
