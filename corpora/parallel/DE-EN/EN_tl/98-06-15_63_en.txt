Mr President, I find it disgraceful that, as Mr Liese says, we in the House are saying that genetic engineering offers huge opportunities and would pose no danger in contained use, as in the report we are discussing today, yet at the same time we are avoiding liability like the plague!
If we deregulate, and state authorizations are therefore limited, then it is not acceptable that industry need not undertake liability for this.
If it supposedly poses no danger, then it is more than suspicious that liability is so vehemently rejected.
I know there has been massive lobbying of Members of this House in recent weeks and, as we can see, this has already had an effect on Mr Liese.
The result of this is that no-one wants to deal with the issue of liability.
This is completely irresponsible as in fact it should be a case of industry showing more responsibility.
The German Federal Government, in particular, never tires of telling us that industry and science must take more responsibility.
If we want individual responsibility we absolutely have to have liability; it is not acceptable that every driver has to have liability insurance before he drives a car but this is not required of companies which work with pathogenic organisms and research laboratories which work with viruses which could escape into the atmosphere.
The report does not meet with our approval because it deregulates many areas; authorization simply because a time limit has elapsed no longer has anything to do with the precautionary principle.
In conclusion, I would like to emphasize once again that the question of liability will be extremely important for us.
It is not for nothing that a recent referendum in Austria showed that a liability regulation is required.
There are also Member States who want it.
So if we want industry to take responsibility itself we must not wait until the damage is done; instead, we must take industry at its word...
(The President cut off the speaker)
