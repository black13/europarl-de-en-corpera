Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as the rapporteur so rightly observed, biotechnology and in particular genetic engineering are expanding greatly.
Within the framework of fair and regulated competition in the European Union it is therefore necessary to form an appropriate legal basis.
This is a very important point and one which is imperative, partly because all regulations in the area of biotechnology in the European Union are based on Article 100a.
This includes the issue of comitology.
It is obvious that the 3b regulatory committee procedure, which the European Parliament completely excludes from the consultations on changing the criteria which allow certain genetically modified micro-organisms to be exempted from the field of application of the directive, is completely unacceptable for us as the European Parliament.
We recently had to abandon a directive on this issue because the Council could not be moved on it.
This is not acceptable to us, however.
If we have cooperation or codecision, the appropriate rights must also be guaranteed for the European Parliament in the committees.
My second point deals with information for the public.
It is stated in the common position that the Member States can stipulate that the public be allowed to give their opinion on specific issues.
What are specific issues?
Who defines these specific issues?
What can it possibly mean?
It is inexplicable that the European Council insists that such an unclear definition, or nondefinition, should remain.
It is also necessary to clarify the situation, within the context of fair competition, as is intended in the amendments.
