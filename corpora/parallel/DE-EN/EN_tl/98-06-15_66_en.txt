Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to mention briefly why we are dealing with this directive.
According to the Commission's explanation, on the one hand genetic modification procedures must be applied responsibly, and on the other hand the increase in scientific knowledge and findings in the last 10 years must be taken into account.
Findings have progressed greatly worldwide.
Europe has set a very strict standard and this directive actually aims to reduce this strict standard and the high degree of bureaucracy associated with it, as experience has shown that what was considered to be high-risk has not turned out that way, thus enabling procedures to be simplified.
I am of the opinion that the points made in the common position are responsible, and I would like this directive also to take effect if possible.
I can support what is proposed in the common position.
