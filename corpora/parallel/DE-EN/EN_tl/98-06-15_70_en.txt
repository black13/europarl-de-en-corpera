Mr President, I would like to ask the Commission a question because Parliament is continually put off with promises of a White Paper on liability, that is, with a horizontal solution.
We, the European Parliament, have taken an initiative and have been waiting for a regulation of this kind for years.
I would like to ask the Commissioner - he sits in the Commission after all and must know how difficult it is there - when, in his opinion, there will be a regulation.
My second question is also based on this: Commissioner, do you believe that the fact that the taxpayer - that is, the general public - must now take responsibility for possible damage is compatible with the responsibility of industry and science?
