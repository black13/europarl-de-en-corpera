Mr President, when discussing humane trapping it is important to note first that the whole course of events is a drama in several scandalous acts.
First I would like to remind you of Regulation 3254/91, which goes back to 1991, and which states that from 1 January 1996 the furs of animals caught using leghold traps should no longer be imported into the EU.
The Commission, together with the Council, simply did not enact any implementing rule and thus sacrificed an EU law which now simply does not exist.
If we look more closely, we find that it was sacrificed on the altar of the WTO.
Secondly, the title: "Humane trapping' .
There is no such thing as humane trapping using any kind of traps!
We are simply deceiving ourselves if we say such a thing.
To the animals which die a wretched death it is completely irrelevant which type of trap is used.
We must finally learn that animals are living creatures and not commodities.
This way of thinking is positively mediaeval.
Yet we are now approaching the year 2000 and still think in this way.
Thirdly, the critical point: this agreement with the USA.
The agreements with Canada and Russia were very rough, in the true sense of the word.
But this overshadows everything else.
There are long transitional phases, there are no legal norms whatsoever and it is not at all clear when it will no longer be permitted to trap animals with this kind of trap.
In addition, it is contempt of Parliament, since we were elected by millions of citizens and are their representatives.
And the people do not want any more leghold traps.
For this simple reason we will of course approve Mr Pimenta's report, and completely reject all existing agreements and the Commission's entire course of action.
