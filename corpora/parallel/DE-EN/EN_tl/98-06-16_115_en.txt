Commissioner, Mr Cunha, Mr President - Mr Cunha has been praised so much today that I would like to turn this around slightly with a minor criticism, because, as he knows himself, he did not discuss the role of women in agriculture in his report.
He will certainly reconsider this before the vote and include it in the motion for a resolution, as he is in fact pro-women.
Throughout the EU, approximately 50 % of all those employed in agriculture are women.
They derive a high level of income for farming families by means of field work, shed work, book-keeping, direct marketing and farm holidays, etcetera.
Farms have now got the message of the European Commission and it does not surprise us very much.
On the whole, it is having a very negative impact, particularly among women farmers, and I believe that the Commissioner for agriculture, Mr Fischler, felt this when he joined us at our meeting in Berlin.
Women farmers are refusing to accept Agenda 2000.
Their criticism is levelled at the increased adjustment of agricultural market policy and price policy to world market levels.
Income policy and price policy are not sufficiently balanced, for example, in the high environmental costs, so that within a short time a considerable number of farming families will find themselves in a situation of extreme hardship.
Farmers - men and women alike - fear the loss of their essential material possessions and their jobs.
We also find the increased pace of gearing European agricultural policy to the world market quite unnecessary.
