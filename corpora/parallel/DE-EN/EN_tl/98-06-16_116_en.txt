Mr President, Commissioner, the report by our honourable friend Mr Cunha includes two particular goals: firstly, the comprehensive approach to farming, and secondly, the ability of farms to survive and adapt, and the strengthening of this ability.
However, these very two aims are under threat in the geographically disadvantaged regions of the new German LÃ¤nder due to the Commission's proposals on degression and upper limits.
In terms of the ability to survive and adapt, no one in Europe has anything to teach East German farmers.
Between 1945 and 1992 these farmers had to deal with three periods of short-term radical restructuring.
They managed that.
In the last period of restructuring, however, 80 % of the population involved in agriculture were eliminated from agriculture within two years.
This was necessary.
Commissioner, particularly in these regions, there is simply no alternative to the farm structures which have survived - mainly cooperatives - that is, no alternative which could guarantee comprehensive management, which is what we all wish for.
An improved, modern agricultural policy, which we all desire, must not further destabilize this form of management, as this would be contrary to the European Union's new employment policy.
