Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is easy to agree on principles, certainly when the principles in question make sense.
Thus, in principle, we happily agree with the Schroedter report and the proposals for the reform of structural policy within Agenda 2000.
Recognizable areas of concentration instead of spreading funds too thinly, objective criteria for the allocation of EU funds, bottom-up partnership, evaluation, what more could we want?
In the interests of those affected, we must want more!
Rural areas, which have already been mentioned today, have not yet been given the necessary consideration, at least not in the initial drafts.
Rural areas must at least be worthy of a subgoal within Objective 2, with guaranteed funding.
In order to meet with the wide approval of our citizens, for the next round of enlargement we will need the opportunities offered by Interreg and a guaranteed level of Interreg funding for the Union's border regions.
Indications from Brussels regarding funding constitute better advice than words of concern from various political ultra-peripheral regions.
Moreover, without upper limits on finance, some so-called net contributors will feel that too much is being asked of them.
The Schroedter report will meet with broad approval only when we allow room not only for the principles but also for particular interests, and I use the term advisedly.
Let us work together with the Commission and the Council to achieve a good balance in the coming months, so that we will have a result which meets with broad approval throughout the Union.
