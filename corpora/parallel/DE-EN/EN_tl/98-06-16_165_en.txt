Mr President, I believe I made it abundantly clear that with the exception of one isolated case we were not aware of any complaints and that we have now taken preventive action.
I believe this guarantees sufficient impartiality.
Of course, where such information is concerned, we cannot prevent the relevant Ministers from issuing this information.
In my opinion, this is even necessary in the interests of correctness of information.
But allow me to emphasize once again that in Greece, in our opinion, not only is party political neutrality guaranteed; some particularly positive steps have also been taken, for example Commission and European Parliament projects in high schools in Greece, which we consider to be exemplary.
I wish that other Member States would make this a subject of study in schools.
In this respect we assume, therefore, that the necessary precautions have been taken to prevent abuse.
