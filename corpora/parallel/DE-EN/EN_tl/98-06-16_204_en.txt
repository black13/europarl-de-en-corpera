Mr President, I believe that educational systems are of particular importance in Europe because our culture is based largely on educational values.
It would be a considerable contribution not only towards promoting education but also an essential basis for lifelong learning.
We should therefore investigate the method to see whether best practice models and benchmarks could not be included so that we can see how an opportunity for Europe can be developed in the various educational possibilities offered.
