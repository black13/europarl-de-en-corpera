Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I must voice my opposition to the Thomas report.
I am speaking on behalf of a large segment of the Group of the European People's Party; not the whole party, but a very sizeable segment of it.
The Thomas report calls for increased protectionism, whereas what is really needed is less protectionism.
We find Amendments Nos 11 and 28 particularly unwelcome, as they represent a drastic reduction in quotas for the three new Member States.
A total of 10 % is being cut from Latin American bananas, and still more problems will ensue.
I very much doubt whether the Commission's proposal is in keeping with WTO ratios.
However, I am quite certain that the demands made by Mr Thomas and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development would in any case lead to enormous problems with the WTO.
We keep hearing - as we have heard in today's debate - that we must protect the small, independent producers in traditional ACP countries and the EU against the 'big bad' multi-nationals in Latin America.
The organization of the market clearly does not do this.
You are all invited to a talk in the press room tomorrow morning with an independent producer from Costa Rica who produces fair trade bananas and has great difficulty with the way the market is organized.
Small producers in Latin America - of whom there are many, in Ecuador, too, for example - are the hardest hit, and that is why we must give more support to fair trade bananas and vote against the Thomas report on this point.
