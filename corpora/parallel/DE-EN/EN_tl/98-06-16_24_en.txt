Mr President, I will limit myself to only a few basic comments.
Commissioner, in the case of prices - whether we fix them now in this prices package or reduce them drastically in Agenda 2000 - the problem remains that an intervention system still exists.
Already, prices are insufficient for 80 % of small and medium-sized farms.
However, it is also a fact that the fixing of intervention prices and the intervention system itself create surpluses in these areas and that the prices - in any case long-term - never rise above the intervention system.
This leads to a situation where most farms cannot live with these prices.
As a result, it is a matter of readjusting the market so that farms can obtain higher prices on the market.
I hope that this is given greater emphasis in Agenda 2000.
I would like to make a point regarding hemp: Commissioner, please give your support to European money being spent on hemp!
Then you will not need to reduce the 25 % because we will then have a huge market.
In addition, the money rustles so nicely and we would have reasonable ongoing support for a very interesting product.
With regard to tobacco, it is my view that the true scandal lies not in the fact that we are promoting a product which endangers our health, but in the fact that, although only a low level of our production is destined for the world market - premiums are also a form of indirect support - billions are spent here to put pressure on the price in the world market overall.
Thus, we are in fact supporting the tobacco industry.
We should see that our tobacco is also being sold here in Europe and that the industry is accepting it.
Here, too, we need a positive strategy - not so much a strategy of prevention.
