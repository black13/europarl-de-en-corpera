Mr President, please allow me to present my criticism in note form, so to speak, because I only have a short time to speak.
Firstly, I would like to discuss the financial provision.
According to the Treaty of Dublin, this should have been 6 %.
That is now out of the question.
I would simply like to point out that America has just decided on an 8 % growth rate, or a total of 32 % over four years.
Next, I would like to address the total disparity between nuclear and non-nuclear energy.
We have earmarked ECU 1 260 million for nuclear energy and ECU 1 004 million for non-nuclear energy - including coal and renewable energy.
I think this is because we are forever chasing the mirage of fusion.
Thus, we would not be doing justice to the task if, for example, I only made reference to the Kyoto Convention.
Besides, an even more pressing task is to probe who actually benefits from growth and what form that growth should take.
Does it make people happier, healthier or more contented?
Does it reduce unemployment?
We need to pay far greater attention to this.
The other matter concerns information technology.
We are entering an era when a segment of the population of the EU - and, not least, citizens of other countries - will in all probability no longer have any part in knowledge because these people are excluded - they cannot participate in the new information technology.
This will lead to a major disparity, not only in the European Union, but also in many other countries with which we do, of course, have to collaborate, for example in Asia or in the developing countries.
I do not know how we will resolve this.
We need to spend a lot more money in working with this trend.
It is not just about energy or the environment; it is also - and more pointedly - about the consequences of the rapid growth of information technology.
