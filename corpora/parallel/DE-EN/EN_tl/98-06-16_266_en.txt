Mr President, I, too, would like to congratulate the rapporteur.
I know it is a difficult task - a bit like squaring the circle.
Irreconcilable interests often have to be reconciled.
It is critical for Parliament to remain united now.
We have one clear adversary, the Council.
We will only be able to resist the Council if we stay on the course we have just mapped out, and I would also ask the Commission to support the House in this.
My second comment addresses a problem that we unfortunately will not be able to solve with the Fifth Framework Programme for Research.
I would like to draw attention to this now.
It is the increasing north-south conflict of industrial competitiveness.
Unfortunately, the southern states have cut back their research expenditure more severely than has been the case in the north, although the southern states only had a relatively low level of expenditure as it was.
This will lead to an even greater northsouth divide in the future.
I would like to ask the Commission to devote special attention to this subject, not because I believe the Fifth Framework Programme for Research can solve the problem - there is far too little money for that.
But the political will must come into being in the south - and by that I mean countries with a smaller gross domestic product - as well as in the north.
The latter are not always richer, but as a rule, they spend more on research.
We need to come up with a solution to this; otherwise, the divide will only get bigger.
It will cost us dearly and we will not be able to bridge it by stepping up regional policy.
I am asking you to reflect on this.
In any case, thank you very much, and I do hope we can stand united as we oppose the Council.
