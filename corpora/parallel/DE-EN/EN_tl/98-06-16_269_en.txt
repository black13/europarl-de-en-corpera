Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as the author of the statement on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I must congratulate the rapporteur.
I welcome the Council's common position, which has taken up the concerns of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, incorporating a separate point on energy, the environment and sustainable development into the topic.
I would particularly like to emphasize the fact that the Council has expressly stressed organic substances in its chapter on ecologically friendly energy systems, including renewable energy sources.
That is a big success, underlining the positive re-thinking process in EU policy.
The facts from Austria, Finland and Sweden show that it is possible to step up the use of renewable energy sources; renewable energy sources account for between 20 and 25 % of energy consumption in these countries.
EU policy is aimed at sustainable development and the sustainable utilization of natural resources, achievable through increased use of these types of energy sources.
To me, this is also very important in view of environmental protection, particularly with regard to further developing rural areas.
In this connection, I also welcome the fact that the Council has come out in favour of the sustainable development of agriculture, fisheries and forestry.
At the same time, I would like to emphasize that in a truly integrated rural economy, mountainous regions must also be considered.
I am critical of the low level of funding.
