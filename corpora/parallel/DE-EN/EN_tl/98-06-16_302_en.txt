Mr President, the WTO ministerial conference in Geneva was no pièce de résistance !
Even a born optimist like Sir Leon Brittan could only describe it as "relatively successful' .
Its reception in the press was even clearer.
The non-event in Geneva got to the heart of the matter: 50 years after the establishment of the GATT system, there is no reason to celebrate.
Global disparities have worsened.
The poor countries have become poorer, in many areas the environment is on the brink of collapse, advances in workers' rights are being dismantled.
Instead of continuing to carry liberalization to extremes, it should principally be a question of evaluating the years that have gone by.
What has gone wrong when the developing countries are losing even more of their share of trade?
What is wrong when WTO panels routinely rule contrary to the interests of the environment and humans?
We do not need trade in genetically modified food to be liberalized; we need some mechanism to protect us from it!
The WTO is in need of constitutional reform!
Trading in products manufactured under harmful conditions must no longer be forced through by a panel.
In concrete terms, Sir Leon Brittan, are you prepared to press for Article 20 of the GATT to be amended?
There is another matter of great importance: we need transparency.
Today, the EU requires good government on the part of third countries before development aid can be granted.
We are demanding good government of the WTO.
Very importantly - and also for the Greek government - we demand good government on the part of our own governments before we enter into a new round of negotiations.
