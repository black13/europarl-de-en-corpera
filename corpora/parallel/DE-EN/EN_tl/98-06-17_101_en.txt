Mr President, first of all, two Members have spoken in favour of this report, so at least two might be allowed to speak against it.
Incidentally, I should like to point out that have we never started referring things back to committee in the middle of a vote before.
Strictly speaking, this amendment should have been tabled in advance.
I should also like to point out that we discussed this matter long and hard in the Committee on Research, Technical Development and Energy, and that we have always said quite openly - on this side of the House at least - that we need to find a route towards renewable energies, and this lays the foundations for it.
If you want to destroy those foundations, all well and good, but that is not what you have been saying until now.
I will not go as far as to say that you have been lying, but this sort of thing cannot be allowed to go on.
As soon as you realize you are losing, you want to send the whole thing back to the committee stage.
If that is to be the case, then our work here in the future will be like that of a nursery school and we will never make any progress.
Mr President, please let the vote continue in order, as it usually would.
