Madame President, I also attended the opening of the exhibition yesterday, and I should like to emphasize that Mr HÃ¤nsch did not only make the comments which you have just reported.
He also quite clearly said something else which I think is far more important in the current discussion, namely that the debate on the Benes Decree cannot be used as some sort of precondition for the accession negotiations we are currently holding with the Czech Republic.
That seems to me to be the most important point in political terms!
