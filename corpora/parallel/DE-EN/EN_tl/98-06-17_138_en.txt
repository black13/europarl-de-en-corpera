Mr President, Commissioner, on this occasion I, too, am unable to share our view that Europe has acted in a timely manner.
This time no one can honestly pretend that we did not know something of this sort would happen.
And it is the case that military terror is being used for ethnic cleansing.
It is a fact.
And we reacted too late.
For years Albanian resistance in Kosovo was based on non-violence.
We failed to use this time to exert pressure on Milosevic through sanctions, to find a solution.
Shamefully, this time was squandered.
Now there is one point which I believe to be particularly important.
We must not only exert this pressure, we must maintain it until one basic right has been accepted by everyone, including the Serbian leadership - the right to return.
He cannot drive out as many Albanians as he will have to allow to return.
We must get this through, it is a really crucial point.
How is it that Milosevic is able to act in this way?
Because he controls the media like a dictator.
It is my view that the European Union should consider what it can do for the Serbs, for the population of Serbia, to show our sympathy and our regret.
Our policy should be directed against the leadership but, of course, not against the Serbian people.
But they have become hostages because they do not know what is going on.
I wonder whether there is not some instrument we could use to tackle the situation, for example by creating an alternative stream of public opinion in Serbia.
I am thinking of a model such as the Radio Free Europe of the past, by which we could give the population of Serbia access to accurate information.
Then I believe that the leadership in Belgrade would not be able to act in the way it is doing now and we would be nearer to achieving our goal of achieving peace, democracy and human rights for everyone in the area - for Albanians and Serbians alike.
