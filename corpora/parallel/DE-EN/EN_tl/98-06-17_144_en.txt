Mr President, what is missing so far in this discussion is a clear expression of how admirable the Albanian people in Kosovo have been and still are today.
For years and years - going back to a period far beyond the one we are currently dealing with - they have endured with incredible patience - I would say an almost Ghandi-like patience - whatever their oppressors have thrown at them.
This has been the pattern for years.
Statements are now being made criticizing the fact that young Albanians have quite simply lost their heads and reacted in military fashion, but we really have no grounds for criticism when we consider Albanians' past record.
That is my first important point.
My second point is the fact that all too little is being said about the most essential aspect of the problem.
The real crimes are being committed by the so-called voluntary units of the Arkan and others which were previously responsible for killings first in Croatia and then in Bosnia and are now all in Kosovo.
This is a second factor which we must stress.
It is simply not enough that Moscow has now said some may be sent back.
In fact, Yeltsin has yet to give his authorization.
We must once and for all call for these so-called guerillas, the Chechniks, to leave.
They are one of the major evils in the whole business.
Today we are discussing the future of Kosovo.
There is, however, one thing I should like to emphasize.
We are democrats and it is time we finally gave the inhabitants of Kosovo the chance to determine their own future.
It is something they have been unable to do for decades and, like other peoples, they are entitled to say how they want to live.
So we must have the courage to speak openly and to demand that dramatic action should be taken at last, for I believe this is a situation which could become just as bad as Bosnia.
