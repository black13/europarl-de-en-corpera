Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, much has been said in this debate, but some of it represents a real challenge.
If it is true that the people of Kosovo cannot easily be afforded the right of self determination because of the overall situation in the region, then a second conclusion also has to be drawn.
As long as Milosevic stays in power it is, of course, extremely difficult to tell the Albanians that they must continue to live under the yoke of Milosevic.
That is the problem.
It means that if we take ourselves seriously we must do everything we can to get rid of Milosevic.
As long as Milosevic stays in power the Albanians will want to leave.
That is only to be expected.
The problem is that our objectives can only be achieved once Milosevic and his terrorism have been removed.
That is my first point.
My second point, Doris, with all due respect, is that if we do not accept that we are bound by international law we can do nothing.
In other words, we must do everything in our power to show Russia and China that they cannot simply say, "Oh, you know, what is happening in Kosovo is not really so bad.
It is what we did in Chechnya.'
Or in the case of China, "It is not so bad, it is what we are doing in Tibet.'
We must tell them quite clearly that there will be no economic cooperation and no support for Russia if they support Milosevic.
In other words, we must secure a UN resolution which permits military intervention and there must be no doubt about it.
We have to do this through the UN because we cannot allow what has happened in Chechnya, in Tibet or in Bosnia to happen in Kosovo.
The only way to proceed is through the UN.
But we must give ourselves the means to be able to say to the Russians and the Chinese, "Enough is enough.'
