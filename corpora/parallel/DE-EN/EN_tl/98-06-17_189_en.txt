Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is clear that there is a ghost creeping through this debate, the ghost of subsidiarity.
It wears several guises: that of Mr Chirac, Mr Kohl, and more recently clearly that of Mr Gallagher.
What is at stake is not providing a clear definition of subsidiarity as a necessary dimension of European integration, but rather using it as a pretext to develop the EU, within the framework of the WTO, as a deregulated community in the face of the single market and the euro, introducing a system of dumping in which we will all be losers.
We all know that the only way out of this dilemma is to achieve common, reliable regulation.
We must put a stop to tax erosion.
And to do this we should take up and support the new convergence introduced by Mr Monti and, perhaps, as it has been increasingly watered down, give it back a little of its original shape.
We have submitted some amendments which head in this direction.
I believe we must make quite clear exactly what the aim of the whole undertaking is.
The aim of the undertaking is to complete the single market by creating the regulatory conditions for fair competition.
Tax competition may be acceptable in terms of the quality, the good design and the proper application of taxation, but not in terms of rates of taxation.
Secondly, we should put an end to the disproportionate burden which, as Mr Monti has illustrated, is imposed on waged work, by shifting the burden to corporate capital and private assets on one hand and the environment and the consumption of resources on the other.
This means we should ensure that capital and business start paying taxes on environmental impact and resources again and thereby create an important precondition for the transition to a sustainable development model.
