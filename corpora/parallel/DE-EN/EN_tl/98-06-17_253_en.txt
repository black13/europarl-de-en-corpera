Mr President, the problem with the Commission's current proposal on customs law and transit is that it is, in reality, unworkable.
We are approaching the enlargement of the EU.
We want to trade with these countries and the system is currently structured as if all goods were sensitive goods like cigarettes, meat and alcohol.
The fact is that normal trade accounts for 99 % of the total and the formal proposals currently under examination are completely unworkable in practice.
As a result, if the system were to come into force in the version currently proposed by the Commission, it would prove absolutely catastrophic for economic relations.
I believe that these strict regulations designed for sensitive areas should not be applied to small consignments and basic necessities.
