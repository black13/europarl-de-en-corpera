Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in his report Mr Secchi has shown a great deal of sensitivity, which is very important in dealing with such a delicate issue.
However, we must under no circumstances allow ourselves to close our eyes to the economic reality of the European Union.
It is a fact that the single currency, the euro, amongst all its positive effects, will also have a politically positive side effect in that it will stimulate extra activity in the overall policymaking of the European Union.
And for me this extra activity means that things will, at last, have to get moving in the tax sector.
It will not stop at coordination.
We will have to move on to harmonization, and there are many reasons why this is the case.
I myself think that we should move away from the principle of unanimity.
Europe needs a certain level of coordination, better coordination in the area of tax policy, precisely because many different levels of tax burden apply in the European Union.
Labour is too heavily taxed.
Corporate groups are largely left to deal with their tax matters as they see fit.
Small- and mediumsized businesses don't really get a look in.
In truth, it is only the international tax consultancies who really benefit profit from the situation.
What we need is better coordination in order to eliminate certain double and multiple taxation problems.
It is quite simply unacceptable that Europe has coordination centres, as is the case in Belgium, which make large loans to groups and subsidiaries of groups with interest payable outside the country in question, where in turn they are subject to very low tax rates and thus in practice manage to avoid the whole taxation process.
This is unacceptable!
These practices exist all over Europe and we must get rid of them.
This is our chance to achieve better harmonization in this sector.
