Mr President, Commissioner Bangemann, ladies and gentlemen, how often in the past have we spoken of revolutionary developments in relation to telecommunications?
As so often before, this also applies to the changes we can expect in wireless and mobile telecommunications.
UMTS not only provides data rates of up to 2 MB per second and ISDN standard speech quality.
It also creates a whole new market for mobile multi-media services.
However, we must look carefully at the various success factors.
The necessary frequency spectrums must be distributed sensibly amongst the network operators.
The total technical cost of UMTS involves high investment costs, but we all want the end price for the customer to be as attractive as possible.
For this reason we must endeavour to keep the cost of licence fees, regulations and other costs as low as possible.
If we do not, we will be unable to achieve satisfactory market conditions in Europe and will put ourselves at an enormous competitive disadvantage in the medium term.
However, let us consider competition on a global scale.
In Japan, the first preliminary stages of UMTS will go into operation at the end of 1999.
If these preliminary stages go on to become de facto standards, network operators in the single market will have to adopt them.
We must at all costs counter this threat with our own activities.
On the other hand, as Mr Camis√≥n Asensio says in his report, Europe is capable of taking both the technological and the strategic lead in this area.
Our advantage lies in our experience of collaboration on matters of standardization, which should serve us as a model for other areas of technical legislation - here I am thinking of the bus directive.
