Mr President, the question of the safety of Europe's citizens in relation to nuclear waste transport is obviously of great importance.
However, the subject can only be dealt with as one detail of a more complex overall issue which deserves our most serious attention.
Until the question of intermediate and final storage has been settled, all matters relating to the commissioning of new nuclear power stations and the re-commissioning of old plants must be rejected out of hand.
As we see it, the European Union should do everything in its power to effect a complete withdrawal from nuclear power and, to this end, should promote alternative sources of energy to a much greater extent.
The European Union had an opportunity to treat this matter as a model.
The safety or otherwise of nuclear waste transport is nothing more than the treatment of a symptom of unsafe development.
It is important.
But it would be even more important if we could treat the root of the problem and stop all further development of nuclear energy.
