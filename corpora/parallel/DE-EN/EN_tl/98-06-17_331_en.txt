Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we must ensure that legislation - both European and international - is implemented correctly.
Objective testing and transparency must be guaranteed immediately and where abuse occurs, legal measures must be taken immediately.
Mr Lange has already mentioned Lenin.
I believe that we must turn our attention to eastern Europe and endeavour to implement safety standards there as quickly as possible.
That is why we must establish joint safety standards in Europe on the broadest possible basis immediately and strengthen our information policy significantly.
