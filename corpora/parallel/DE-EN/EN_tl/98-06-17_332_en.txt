Mr President, Commissioner, as I listened to your explanations, I remembered how last year President Santer, full of enthusiasm, stood in this place and shouted out the words, "Let us make this Union a Union of health.'
But the protection of the people of Europe's health has been neglected when it comes to transporting nuclear waste.
If this were not the case, transport workers, convoy staff and even people protesting against the transport would not have been exposed to radiation.
It should also be remembered that these consignments are merely in transit; there is still no final place of storage for nuclear waste.
The research goes on, but we have yet to find a solution.
We do not only need, we must also implement uniform security regulations, Mr Chichester, because when Caesar said that his wife should be beyond reproach, he was in fact announcing his divorce because his wife had hidden from him things that had happened in his own house.
And that is just the point!
It is unacceptable that things should be hidden from people, that the Commission, the companies and the Member States do not have free access to all information so that they can pass it on to the public.
A number of Member States have refused to use nuclear energy as a source of electricity.
However, the consignments pass through these countries too, because often there is no way round it in Europe for geographical reasons.
I see no reason why people should be exposed to this risk and believe that the funds we so generously spend on Euratom should finally be used to draw up a set of safety regulations which would then apply to all Member States and all new applicants for membership in order to guarantee safety in Europe.
For security cannot be parcelled out, and we cannot keep pushing the blame back and forth from one side to the other.
