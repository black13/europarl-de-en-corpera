Mr President, I would just like to ask two questions which I would be grateful if you would pass on to the competent commissioner.
Firstly, when will we receive the minutes of the standing working group?
Secondly, will a reporting duty for company transporters and transports at long last be introduced now?
This information does not appear in any of the directives.
Thirdly, I would just like to say that contamination reaches this high level on arrival, not departure.
