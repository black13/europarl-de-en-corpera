Mr President, I would like to point out that it is, of course, the right of any Member to present his candidacy for the post of Vice President.
It is also the democratic right of the Groups in this House to propose Vice-Presidents.
Mr Martens has already pointed out that although internal agreements do exist - between the large groups, as you said, but, of course, there are other groups in the House, too - there are also agreements which are not necessarily supported by this House as the election of Mr Killilea as Quaestor has already shown.
Here the House, in its great wisdom, has made a decision which is different to that which the "arrangement' might have dictated.
For this reason it is our democratic right to present to the House a candidate from the Green Group in the European Parliament, in the belief, incidentally, that it is entirely appropriate to consider whether, in a committee such as the Bureau of the European Parliament, it would not be right, proper and democratic if all groups were to be represented, rather than having the present situation in which three groups have no representation at all.
Three groups in this House are entirely unrepresented in the Bureau, as are the independents.
For this reason, this candidacy is a candidacy which will bring a little more democracy into this House at a time when the Bureau is holding very important debates.
(Applause)
