Mr President, with respect for your management of proceedings, Mr Provan has described quite clearly exactly what happened during the vote on Recital A. You called for the vote on Recital A, and the first calls of "check' were heard immediately afterwards.
However, you proceeded to Recital B immediately.
You then decided, quite rightly in my view, to allow another vote on Recital A by way of a check.
As I see it, you then allowed yourself to be dissuaded from holding this vote by the argument put forward very vociferously by the other side of the House.
That cannot be right.
As a result, I did not take part in the subsequent vote and would now request that this matter be cleared up once and for all.
