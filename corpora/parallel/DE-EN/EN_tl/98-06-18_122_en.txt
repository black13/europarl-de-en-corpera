Mr President, Madam Commissioner, five underground nuclear tests by the Indians in Rajastan were answered by six nuclear tests by the Pakistanis in Baluchistan.
The reaction in the West: anger and dismay.
In Asia overwhelming enthusiasm.
Who the winners will be in this dreaded arms race is unclear.
The current losers are millions of people.
They do not hunger for power and national prestige, but for opportunities to escape from poverty and to enjoy the training and education that has been denied them.
India's nuclear tests are the response to China which has been developing its nuclear arsenal for years.
Where is the Western protest here?
Even in Tibet atomic weapons are being stockpiled, and China is supplying Pakistan with weapons know-how and rocketry.
Will Islamic Pakistan and the largest democracy in the world, India, be prepared to sign an international nuclear agreement if they are recognized by the industrial countries as negotiating partners?
When we can rely on the monitoring committees of the nuclear states and when nuclear safety can be finally guaranteed, then it will be easier to sign both the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Test Ban Treaty, which needs to be finally ratified by the US Congress.
