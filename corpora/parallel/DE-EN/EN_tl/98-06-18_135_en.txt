Mr President, this conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea has surprised and disturbed us all.
We are worried that the region will be further destabilized.
We are worried that a tragedy is waiting to happen.
Those affected are first and foremost the people in this region.
They are already badly affected by belonging to one of the poorest regions in the world, and now war is to be added to their lot.
Border conflicts of this kind are often the expression of internal political conflicts and differences, in both Ethiopia and Eritrea.
We are of the opinion that this conflict should not be allowed to escalate.
The European Union is called upon to support the diplomatic efforts.
We welcome the efforts of the OAU, the USA and Rwanda.
The Council said in its last statement on the Cardiff Summit that it condemns the conflict, that it wishes to support the diplomatic solutions and that it is also prepared, should negotiations come about, to lend material assistance.
We should support this as a Parliament and you too, Madam Commissioner, should support it on behalf of the Commission.
We must try to find a diplomatic solution and assist the people in the region directly through material aid.
