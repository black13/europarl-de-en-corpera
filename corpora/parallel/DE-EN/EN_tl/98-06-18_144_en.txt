Mr President, Madam Commissioner, the European Convention on Human Rights with the protocol abolishing the death penalty belongs to the legal bases of the European Union.
The EU is therefore obliged to raise its voice in the international dialogue calling for this penalty to be abolished.
I endorse what the previous speakers have said, that this House should unanimously support and enact the concrete measures proposed.
We must do everything to ensure that the death penalty, which is an archaic remnant from the times of sacral law, disappears from our legal system, which is based on human rights and hence cannot tolerate a type of punishment which eliminates the human being as a legal entity.
