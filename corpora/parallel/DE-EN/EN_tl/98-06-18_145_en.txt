Mr President, the great Swiss national economist Felix Somari said in his book 'The Crisis and Future of Democracy' the following: ' To apply the death penalty to a multiple murderer means only atoning for the first murder.
All the other murders go unpunished.'
This was one of a whole series of his arguments against the death penalty.
One thing is clear to me from this: the death penalty is, all legitimate moral scruples apart, nothing more than a trivialization of the crime for which this punishment is often given.
A genuine life sentence is in most cases surely the more humane solution, while also the stiffer penalty.
That is why I am very happy that this resolution will hopefully be adopted today by the European Parliament without amendment and without any fuss.
This is very much in keeping with the activities of our Parliament, even though I would be especially pleased if we could finally address the question of the death penalty on the basis of a clearly defined moratorium without the customary deviousness so often found.
If the State in question is a very minor one, it is quickly condemned.
But if the State is more important, then this is usually more difficult.
I am thinking, for example, of China, where we once tried to deal with the issue of trade in human organs taken from prisoners condemned to death.
I would like to draw attention to something else too.
Whenever we talk about the actual death penalty, we should focus on the form of execution that is most frequently practised here at home, namely the termination of unborn life.
It is now high time to look at this from a new perspective, since this is carried out in most cases, sadly, without recourse to legal proceedings.
