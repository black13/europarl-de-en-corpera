Madam President, we have often debated human rights violations in Chad.
We had hoped that the situation would change once the President assured us, after the human rights violations in October 1997, that these would not happen any more.
This year, in March, 100 civilians or village elders were massacred by the military.
The latest case of human rights violations we witnessed in connection with an event of the European Parliament, the 2nd P7 Summit, for the Poorest Seven, which took place in Brussels last week.
A member of the Chad Parliament was supposed to deliver a speech on the oil project in Dobabecken at 9.30 a.m. on the Friday.
The colleague from Chad, Mr Yorongar, had a court appointment at 9.30 a.m. and was given an extended prison sentence.
He has been in custody since 3 June simply because he criticized this project.
The project provides for 300 oil wells in the south of Chad, a 170 km long pipeline in Chad and a 700 km pipeline in Cameroon.
In our opinion analysis of whether this is socially compatible has been insufficient, or rather the population has not been involved.
Likewise where the environment is concerned, not enough precautionary measures have been taken.
We are not against this in principle, but a democratic development, the involvement of the population and the observation of environmental standards, which are required by the World Bank, ought to be assured.
The World Bank has earmarked some 55 million US dollars for Chad and 58 million for Cameroon and claims it is creating jobs.
4, 000 jobs in a region where 28, 000 live off a subsistence economy cannot be real jobs for the region.
If 8, 000 litres of oil are escaping into the environment each day due to leakage, then the environmental compatibility tests cannot be adequate.
We ask both the World Bank and the EU, along with Shell, Exxon and Elf, to reconsider this project and only to continue with it once a situation which respects human beings is guaranteed.
