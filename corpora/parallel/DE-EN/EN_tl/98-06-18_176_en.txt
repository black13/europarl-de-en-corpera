Madam President, anyone familiar with Guinea-Bissau in the past is aware of the reasons for the present crisis.
A few decades ago the people still lived relatively well.
Perhaps they were not rich, there was no great development, but the Portuguese really achieved something to be proud of there.
The country then collapsed through corruption and international intervention.
I think you just have to admit that environmental protection, for instance, is today nothing short of terrible.
When I was there, a long time ago now, people could really live on islands like Bijag√≥s.
They had enough to eat, whereas now everything has been destroyed by pollution.
That is the price that has been paid for government without conscience - the present one has been much better, but up to now it has had to settle the bill.
We should be doing everything we can to help the extremely likeable people of Guinea-Bissau to get back on the right track.
