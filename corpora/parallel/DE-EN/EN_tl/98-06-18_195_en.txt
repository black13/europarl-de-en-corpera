Madam President, Commissioner Cresson, I think that the urgent and topical debate here is possibly our last chance to reconsider exactly the financial investment being made by the European Union in the Cambodian elections, which after all amounts to almost ECU 10 million, and to look at the conditions under which this money is to be used.
When I read from the list of investments made, for example, that a large part has been used to support and educate journalists in the region of Cambodia and in the country itself, then I have to say - as someone who knows something about the situation - that this is tremendously difficult because the latest news is that in the last state purge the final opposition journalists were murdered and there are currently only journalists there who are loyal to the government.
I am very glad to hear Mrs Kinnock say that there are experts from our side there, too, trying to sort out the media.
However, I have certain doubts about this, and we should really consider the exact nature of our involvement in this area.
I think another point requires careful consideration too, and that is our collaboration with the United States of America.
The latter have taken a clear stance on their involvement in the Cambodian elections and have adopted a very distanced attitude to them.
They are no doubt interested, like us, in a genuine democratic process, and I think in this case we should collaborate with them and agree a common position.
