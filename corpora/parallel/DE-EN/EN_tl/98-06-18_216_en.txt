Madam President, as crucial as it is to insist on common principles of taxation in a single market, it is as vital, however, to adopt a clear position against the dominant tendency in the States of the European Union towards creeping tax increases.
For example, the benefit derived from closing tax loopholes, as we so nicely term them, will only be slight if sufficiently attractive financial centres exist simultaneously throughout the world.
In fact, mobile risk capital will escape from Europe while its honest and hard-working citizens continue to be fleeced of their savings.
The enormous increase in risk capital can be attributed to, among other things, the high taxation of money entering the production process.
It is not the tax oases that have a distorting effect on the internal market, but rather the excessively high corporation taxes and excise duties.
I have spoken out against parts of the report because it skirts around this very real problem.
We have countries in the present Union where the level of taxation is approaching the 50 % mark.
Our clear aim therefore must be an obvious reduction in this tax burden.
There is the principle here that, within the meaning of subsidiarity, the State does not have the right to increase the tax burden and then to re-distribute gifts to its citizens indirectly by way of an expensive bureaucracy.
In this context one should recollect the American economist Arthur Laffer, who proved that above a taxation level of 25 % concealment of income increases progressively.
The black economy is a logical consequence of this.
