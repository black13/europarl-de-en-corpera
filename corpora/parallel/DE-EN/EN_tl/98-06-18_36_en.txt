Mr President, I would like as a German Member of Parliament to thank the President-in-Office in his capacity as the British Prime Minister for his tremendous involvement in the peace process in Northern Ireland.
I do so as a German MEP because I love Ireland and consider it one of my favourite holiday destinations.
Secondly, I would like to thank the Presidency - and especially the British one - for its involvement in the final steps towards monetary union, and I say as a German MEP: We want Britain inside of the currency union!
That is why I am especially grateful for the UK involvement, even if it should continue for a bit longer.
Thirdly, with the Treaty of Amsterdam a historic epoch has drawn to a close because the European unification process in the past was very heavily characterized by old-style diplomacy.
Progress has been made and now Parliament-controlled policy has the job of making more progress with unification.
At the same time, the European Parliament and the parliaments of the Member States will need to safeguard their rights.
Our rights must be further extended.
Each new step towards integration following the Treaty of Amsterdam needs to improve the contractual arrangements allowing European political parties to continue to develop so that the parliamentary system is also improved.
My fourth point concerns Agenda 2000.
It will not surprise anyone - and I agree fully with Mr Böge's factual statement - that the agenda is very tight, and the German presidency needs to bring this to a satisfactory conclusion.
The difference is that it will be a social-democratic President - the Chancellor to be precise - who will hold the office.
In other respects I share Mr Böge's opinion.
