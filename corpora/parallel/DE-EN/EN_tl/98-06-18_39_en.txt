Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the President-in-Office began his remarks with the statement that Model 14/1 is no longer practicable.
We should endorse this.
This is no doubt a good thing for Europe.
Yet besides the historic step towards monetary union taken at the start of May there has been progress in other areas too.
For example there are now ratified Europol conventions.
There are initial steps being made towards collaboration in justice and internal affairs.
The action plan to combat organized crime is gradually being implemented.
However, there are deficiencies too.
Why, Mr President-in-Office, is Europol not starting its work by 1 July?
Why is it impossible for a German court to make initial contact with a British court in the interests of those seeking justice?
That is to say, we have reached the stage of great cordial declarations.
They stir up our expectations, yet reality is lagging behind.
The concept of 'national sovereignty' is held up as not approving of all this.
I ask you, Mr President-in-Office, how can national sovereignty be levelled against the requirements of citizens' security?
Why is progress not possible in a European area which the people would welcome with open arms, in contrast to other developments where they are more reserved?
Europe's citizens want Europol to commence its work against organized crime.
I think much more progress could have been possible in this area.
You have expressed your intention, which I welcome, of improving relations with Turkey as well as setting in place the financial framework of the Customs Union agreement.
I would like to point out to you that this would also be a way of combating organized crime and drug-trafficking in Europe.
Because it is via Turkey that a lot of the drugs are entering Europe.
Without improved cooperation successful crime prevention is not possible.
Hence I can only call upon you to continue on this course.
