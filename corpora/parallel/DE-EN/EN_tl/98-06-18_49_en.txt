Mr President, there is actually a procedural problem with the compromise submitted on Cardiff.
I shall explain this as politely as I can.
The following has happened: We were presented with a compromise with the assurance, which was confirmed by the services at 9.00 p.m., that in the Cardiff compromise the issues of Kosovo and the Middle East would not be included because there were separate resolutions on this.
We have separate resolutions both on Kosovo and on the Middle East.
The services told us that these were incompatible and therefore we signed a compromise in which paragraphs 16 and 17 did not appear.
This was confirmed at 9.00 p.m.
This morning we are now being told that a subsequent submission was made after 9.00 p.m., by whom - if I might be allowed to explain - I do not know, but allegedly on behalf of all the parties who had signed the compromise.
No-one asked us!
Therefore I could not have supported this subsequent submission.
Furthermore, we gave no blank signature for use as an endorsement, as some would have you believe.
