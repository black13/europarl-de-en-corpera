Mr President, the submission deadline was 9.00 p.m.
That is why I am asking how it is at all possible for a submission to be made after 9.00 p.m!
Just imagine if we Greens had done that.
We would have been beaten about the head with the Rules of Procedure or some such thing and been summarily told off!
Hence I would ask you to keep to the procedure and remove paragraphs 16 and 17 from this resolution.
I was not consulted and I am not prepared to give my name to something which in reality is different from that which was first presented to me.
