Mr President, since I was the one to negotiate the compromise on behalf of our group, I need to make one or two things clear at this point.
It is correct - and we have since verified this - that Mrs Green, the other MEPs and myself were not present for a while, but rather our colleagues discussed among themselves what might be possible, and that is the way things were actually discussed.
When I then saw the resolution, the services assured me it was an alternative.
Either the paragraphs are included or there is a resolution, that is to say it would mean the resolution being deleted.
In response I only stated verbally - and I am being self-critical here - that I would be signing it there and then, proceeding from the assumption that both these paragraphs would not be included.
That is why I have now personally withdrawn my signature.
This does not mean that the group is withdrawing its signature because we still have a third signature involved.
Given my background, in Germany, I cannot support the wording used here.
