Mr President, as you all know, we had a debate last night on the Commission's statement about nuclear transport.
The Commissioner present on this occasion, however, who had obviously made a considerable effort and was very polite - since he is responsible for publicity - had no idea about the subject matter.
We could have saved ourselves the debate.
He was unable to reply to any of the questions.
As if that were not enough, he read out a statement by the Commission which was clearly false.
It said in the statement that the Commission knew nothing about the contamination from the castor containers until the 23 April of this year.
I could prove without a shadow of a doubt, however, that the Commission had already written about it in its communication of 3 April 1996.
Of course, the Commissioner could say nothing in answer to this - it is obvious; it is not his brief.
I would therefore ask that care be taken to ensure that someone is present from the Commission who is capable of entering into a real debate.
Otherwise we will have to forego debates of this kind, because they would just be a waste of time.
(Loud applause)
