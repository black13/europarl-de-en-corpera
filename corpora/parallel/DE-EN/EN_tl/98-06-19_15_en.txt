They should have taken a little olive oil before they came!
I have therefore proposed that the procedure involving the Management Committee for Oils and Fats be replaced by the procedure described in Article 43(2) of the Treaty establishing the European Community.
I have also tabled amendments to make consultation of the European Parliament compulsory.
With regard to the system of national guaranteed quantities, I believe that the need to ensure compliance with the maximum guaranteed quantity must be emphasized, in order to avoid unfortunate divergences such as those which have occurred with regard to the quotas for dairy products.
Finally, as far as infringements of the aid schemes are concerned, the twelve months proposed by the Commission in which to adopt a decision with regard to further action to be taken following the detection of infringements is too long and will make the decision less effective.
A period of six months would be preferable, as suggested by the Committee on Budgetary Control.
Finally, I should like to remind you of the urgent need to obtain full, reliable statistics on the production of olive oil in the various producer Member States.
Before the adoption of this regulation, it would be preferable for the Court of Auditors to have completed their verification of these statistics.
That is, in brief, the reasoning behind the amendments in my report, which the Committee on Budgetary Control has approved.
