Madam President, olive growing is of great cultural, but also economic, significance and therefore the identity of European olive cultivation must be guaranteed right up to the level of regional allocation.
The stock of olive trees may well be of importance to us - also an important ecological factor - but that is not enough.
It is also a matter of considering olives as a social factor, in other words, in relation to the number of jobs in this sector.
What is more, in the policy of the Commission it must be clear that we are dealing here with an important foodstuff.
The objective, therefore, must not be to support a type of cultivation that is difficult to market, but instead the marketing, processing and regional allocation must be supported, taking into consideration the demand for olive oil from consumers.
Only if we move in the direction of a regional market will it be possible to resolve the difficulties that we face, despite pumping billions into this sector and still losing jobs.
