Mr President, I am happy to reply to these points.
First may I make it clear that the Commission cannot, of course, take over all the amendments, but that it, too, has its duty to perform.
But I refer to what I said in my earlier contribution.
I would like to remind you of it again.
First, we have addressed five fundamental wishes of Parliament with our proposal.
Second, we have a certain sympathy towards many of your amendments.
Third, we will also examine a series of amendments in our further deliberations.
