Madam President, I would like to praise the exemplary activity of the French security service during the visit by Tony Blair.
Secondly, I would like to inform you that President Gil-Robles has received a letter from Prime Minister Dehaene promising us that a police station will be established in the vicinity of the Parliament in Brussels.
