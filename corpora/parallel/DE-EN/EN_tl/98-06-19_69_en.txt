Mr President, I would like to make two points.
Firstly, the wording of Amendment No 31in our documents does not match the wording that was agreed on in the committee.
It was indeed said in committee that this amendment had to be changed and that it had to be introduced as an Article, and not in the financial statement for administrative reasons.
But the wording as presented here was not the resolution of the committee.
You could say that the committee decided on the meaning but not the wording of its resolution.
I am putting this on record and would ask Parliament's services to check how one should proceed in such a case.
In order that everyone knows what we are voting on: it is a matter here of the financial sum involved.
The committee proposes ECU 500 million.
The procedure in the House, however, - even the Commission sees it in this way, in my view, and perhaps the Commissioner can comment on this - is that financial sums are normally set in the budgetary procedure.
Colleagues in the Committee on Budgets have also asked me to point out once more that this is an unusual procedure and that actually the application ought to be rejected.
The committee, however, is in favour and for that reason, as rapporteur, I must also say that, in accordance with the spirit of the resolution, the committee has agreed to increase this financial amount.
