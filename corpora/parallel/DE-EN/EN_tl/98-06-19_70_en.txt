Mr President, on this point, I would also like to mention Amendment No 38.
But was this not retracted, Mr Liese?
Then that will be explicitly recorded.
On the question of setting the sum, it is not a matter of a budgetary procedure or the anticipation of a budgetary procedure but it concerns a political declaration of intent.
For this reason I find it important that we take a vote on this.
Yet another application is contained subsequently in the legislative resolution, which provides for the increase to ECU 500 million.
We can, therefore, take a vote on it without anticipating the budgetary procedure.
But by doing so we give expression to the fact that we want to use financial resources here too.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
