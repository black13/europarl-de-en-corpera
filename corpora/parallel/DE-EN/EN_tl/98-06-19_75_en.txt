Mr President, on behalf of the PPE Group and pursuant to Rule 131 of the Rules of Procedure, I request that the debate be postponed until the next mini-part-session in Brussels.
We attach great importance to this debate.
It is obvious that it cannot take place in an appropriate form under the existing conditions.
For this reason, we ask the House to vote in favour of our request for postponement.
