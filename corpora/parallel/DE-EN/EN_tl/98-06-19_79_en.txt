Mr President, I would like to give my express support to the request made by Mr Nassauer.
I would also add one comment on the other decisions that we have reached this morning: if this house is not to degenerate into a large gymnasium for building up our biceps, because we spend more time voting on the dotting of "i' s and crossing of "t' s than on political discussion ...
... and we do this in every week-long part-session, then I ask you finally to consider preventing such incidents as the current one from being repeated.
It is a matter here of consultations within the framework of the third pillar, where the only possibility of democratization is the debate here in Parliament and we have nothing else to offer the Council than an undebated, albeit inexpensively balloted, opinion.
That is not something which contributes to the strengthening and the reputation of the European Parliament.
For this reason we have no other choice, for the sake of our own credibility, than to proceed as Mr Nassauer has proposed.
(Applause)
