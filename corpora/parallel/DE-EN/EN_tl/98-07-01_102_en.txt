Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to pay tribute to the rapporteur, Mr Novo Belenguer.
I can support the main conclusions of the own-initiative report.
However, in Germany we have found that successful spatial development policy needs a bottom-up approach.
Regionally balanced social and economic development, in other words spatial cohesion, can only be achieved if local communities and regions are equally involved in spatial planning and decision-making from the outset.
A top-down approach to spatial development is wasteful of people's energy, entails the risk of bad planning and our citizens are reluctant to accept it.
The rapporteur is, therefore, quite right in calling for the principle of subsidiarity to be strictly observed in implementing the ESDP.
I believe that we should reject any attempt in the ESDP to tie EU Structural Funds to spatially relevant programmes.
I am also afraid that they could be used as financing and regulatory instruments of regional planning policy.
I do not think that we have any reservations about generally grouping regions into target areas or about the control and coordinating function which the Commission accordingly has to exercise.
However, a European Spatial Development Perspective is not needed for this.
Instead, the implementation of EU structural assistance should remain the responsibility of Member States, and should not be made more difficult because of additional regional planning criteria, so that it becomes a greater burden for Member States involving increased administrative expenditure.
We should reject any attempts to make structural and sectoral development policy in the Member States subordinate to key regions and central locations under a European Spatial Development Perspective.
We must not lose sight of that in this debate.
