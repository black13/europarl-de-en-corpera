Mr President, when the Council decided in 1991 to extend the existence of duty-free shopping until 1999, it could certainly not have known that unemployment in the EU in 1998 would be 18 million and rising.
The Council also had no idea that in 1999, despite monetary union becoming a reality, there would still be no question of tax harmonization.
So the internal market has not really been completed.
The Council and Commission's inflexibility on this point borders on irresponsibility!
Abolishing duty-free means killing several birds with one stone, in a negative sense, of course.
A large number of additional unemployed people will come onto the job market.
The EU will voluntarily sacrifice an important shop window for its branded export goods, and the tourist trade will suffer demonstrable damage.
A cynic might say that the first concrete employment policy measure taken by the Community will be the destruction of over 100 000 jobs by abolishing duty-free.
I find it absolutely incomprehensible that the Council has not reviewed its position given the situation in the job market.
There is a wide and unanimous consensus that the main topic of political debate and the objective of all our actions should be the fight against unemployment.
So why is not possible to reach unanimous agreement to alter this decision, which will clearly create so many additional unemployed?
The new President of the Council, Austria's Federal Chancellor, yesterday appealed to the EU partners to make the fight against unemployment the focus of their attention.
If he means that seriously, than he should convince his partners that by keeping duty-free, many jobs would be saved.
