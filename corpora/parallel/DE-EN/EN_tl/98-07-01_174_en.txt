Thank you very much, Madam President, particularly for giving me an opportunity not only to congratulate the rapporteur, but also to say that he is an excellent role model for people willing to retrain from being theologians or musicians to real technicians and politicians!
Let me now change over into my own language and say something on the report itself.
In my opinion, we have here a typical example of how the Council could have shown for once through deeds, rather than just through words, how we, in this Parliament, as a body support the idea of a general shift from road to railways and inland waterways.
We are once again here compelled to accept that we will have a major collapse in traffic before long if we do nothing.
The responsibility for this lies with the Council and the Commission, not with Parliament.
