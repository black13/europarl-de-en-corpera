Mr President, I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak.
I put my name down to do so some time ago, but perhaps you need more staff in the Bureau so that you are aware of all the Members wishing to speak.
I should like to raise one point.
At the last sitting in Strasbourg at midday on Friday, we agreed at short notice to adjourn a number of agenda items until the next sitting as there were not enough Members in attendance.
This is now the next sitting.
The items in question do not appear on the agenda.
When do you intend to deal with these items in the House?
