Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for clarifying a number of the points which I had intended to raise.
You are quite right to stress that the Court's ruling must be adhered to, but this is precisely the point of my question, which relates in particular to Paragraphs 39 to 42 of the ruling.
In this respect, the Commission's action differs fundamentally from what the ruling says.
The ruling has exempted a whole range of existing contracts and payments from suspension.
The Commission is proceeding on a very different basis.
It is examining everything and is now giving us a total of everything it has examined, but this does not satisfy the concern felt by the general public.
I would like to ask you to respond now to this public concern by providing a second answer in line with the wording of the ruling, which refers to specific categories.
Secondly, you have repeatedly told us that you are working towards an interinstitutional agreement.
However, our priority is to find legal bases - and since you have also argued in these terms, I assume it must be your priority too - and an interinstitutional agreement is not a legal basis in terms of the ruling's requirements.
