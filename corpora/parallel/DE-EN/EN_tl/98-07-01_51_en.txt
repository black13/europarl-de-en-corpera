Mr President, I think that you should give an answer to this question in your capacity as President.
The point is that we cannot ask - or indeed complain about - the Commission because there has been a shift of power: the Commission and Parliament are now in the same boat with regard to the Council.
It is now time for Parliament to make a statement on this issue.
I think that you yourself have recognized that Parliament has become weaker, and it is up to us, as Parliament, to take a political initiative to ensure that this shift of power which has occurred - and I think there has been a shift of power vis-a-vis the Council - is removed by Parliament.
I would ask you to ensure that this item is included on the agenda at the next part-session in Strasbourg and that we, as Parliament, take an initiative to restore Parliament's power in this respect.
It is a question of the Treaty; perhaps, on principle, a codecision procedure should be introduced ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
