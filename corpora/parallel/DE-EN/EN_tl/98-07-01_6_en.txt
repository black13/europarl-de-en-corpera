Mr President, I refer to Rule 151 of the Rules of the Procedure, which states that the meetings of the committees are open to the public.
One of my visitors, who is a wheelchair user, experienced great difficulty getting into the D III building.
May I ask you to ensure that disabled people have access to this building?
