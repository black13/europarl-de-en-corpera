Mr President, this report is held up mainly by the issues of consumer protection and the prevention of abuse of trading channels.
What is completely lacking is consumer motivation.
We are also lacking the understanding that this is a form of development aid in which we must reach the consumer so that we may be able to motivate him or her to pay higher prices.
We are not marketing a product, we are marketing an idea.
My only reservation is that the bureaucratization heralded in the report will only prevent this.
We must finally realize that Europe also has a responsibility to help developing countries to sell their products in Europe.
In this form the report is a good idea.
What is missing is the consumer motivation to buy these products.
