Mr President, the rapporteur has taken a great deal of time and care in preparing this report and we thank him for this.
The committee also contributed over 50 amendments to the document which we have before us.
Please do not be offended if I say that the final result is not quite a success.
There is still a lot of talk about protection and support measures and too little said about the structures which lead to market place competitiveness.
In committee, my group attempted to focus on a few points in pursuit of this aim, and indeed the amendment by Mrs Maij-Weggen does so.
Above all, we must take care that we do not leave too much room for bureaucracy.
Less bureaucracy would seem to be assured if we support the amendment rather than if we use the original formulation which goes into so much detail as to hardly be practicable.
I am also concerned about the proposal to use funds from co-financing to advertise fair trade.
I am unsure that the already overstretched B7-6000 line should feature here.
In addition, this is one of the budget lines whose legal bases are currently under dispute.
Nonetheless, I hope that common trade with third world countries, including the fair trade discussed here, continues to develop in a positive way, and I also hope that the Commission will continue to support us in this.
