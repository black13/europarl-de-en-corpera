Mr President, I would ask you to allow the Commission to speak tomorrow on a subject which is not provided for in the agenda, and in this respect to add it to the agenda.
In the coming week we will be travelling to Bosnia with a delegation from this House.
In the meantime, at the weekend, we learned that subsidies for the former Yugoslavia were misappropriated by ECHO and, in addition, the Commission staff involved obviously had the opportunity - as I understand it from the press, as UCLAF was not in a position to provide the Committee on Budgetary Control with sufficient information regarding this - to allow files to disappear, with the result that it is extremely difficult to investigate the case in detail.
I consider it important - Mrs Gradin is here among us today - that we be allowed at least a brief explanation of this issue from the Commission itself, so that the delegation can travel next week in possession of all the facts.
