Mr President, I would ask you to put to the vote the motion tabled by Mrs MÃ¼ller.
We have only been aware of events in Bosnia-Herzegovina since the end of the week and it would be very important for our delegation to be given official Commission information regarding the course of events before travelling there.
This should be done this week.
