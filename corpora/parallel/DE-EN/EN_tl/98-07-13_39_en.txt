Mr President, the issue here is that the delegation is going to Bosnia in order to evaluate the situation prior to the discharge which has already been postponed.
We want to see, in September, whether a discharge can then be proposed to the House.
The visit by this delegation was decided by the House, and the composition of the delegation was arranged and approved.
But at the weekend all imaginable information regarding ECHO was in the newspapers.
I believe we should investigate this thoroughly, and I do not believe that an explanation to the House is sufficient.
This would render the investigations invalid.
For this reason I think we should discuss this issue with Mrs Gradin, the members of the delegation and the members of the Committee on Budgetary Control.
I propose that we appoint a day, if possible this week and that, due to the urgency of the matter, we approve a sitting during this part-session.
However, I will continue to seek a hearing with you, if the House is in agreement, as we require exact documentation and information which we can rely upon.
This certainly cannot be done within two or three days on the basis of articles from the press.
