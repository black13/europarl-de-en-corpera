Mr President, the point at issue is whether a uniform European law on migration is currently required, whether the time is right for it.
The controversial dispute in committee about this very issue underlines its importance.
We believe that the variation in immigration pressure on the individual Member States is not mainly due to the different national rules but to the economic and also topographic situations of the individual Member States, which determine their attractiveness to potential immigrants.
Therefore, in our opinion, the individual Member States must continue to have the power to adjust their immigration laws according to the situation, and thus respond to the situation with different immigration regulations.
From this point of view, harmonization would not, in our opinion, be the correct solution.
Thus, for example, in Member States with long external EU borders, such as Austria, the consequences of a common regulation for frontier workers would be very different from those in the other Member States.
What is almost incomprehensible, in view of the increase in crime caused by foreigners and the intensified fight against crime which forms the focal point of a European Union programme, is the request that convicted foreigners should no longer be expelled.
The same applies to the proposal to widen the conditions for family reunification, as the rapporteur explained.
Bearing in mind that, instead of the planned convention, a directly applicable regulation or at least a directive could come into force in the Member States immediately after the Treaty of Amsterdam has taken effect, we reject the report.
We are also rejecting it because the planned rule makes a regionally adjusted reaction to migratory flows impossible and, in contrast to the rules currently applicable in Austria, would significantly facilitate immigration, without justifying it objectively, and thus lead to a loss of security.
