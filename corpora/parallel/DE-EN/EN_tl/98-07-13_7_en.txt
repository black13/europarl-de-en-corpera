Mr President, thank you very much for giving me the opportunity, very commendably and notwithstanding the rules, to table a motion pursuant to Rule 129 of the Rules of Procedure, relating to the report by our colleague, Maria Berger; with strong support from our group she produced an excellent report on an extremely sensitive and difficult topic and submitted it for today's sitting.
However, following all the talks which Mrs Berger and I myself, as coordinator of our group, held in this House on the subject of the report, we do not see how we could achieve a majority vote for this report outside the Socialist Group.
Therefore, pursuant to Rule 129, I request that you hold a vote on whether this report should be referred back to committee so that a discussion can take place there on how to proceed.
I would justify this briefly by saying that for such a sensitive topic every effort should be made to sound out the possibilities of reaching a consensus.
That is not possible today.
Perhaps we will have this opportunity once again.
Please ensure that Mrs Berger has this opportunity for her magnificent work.
