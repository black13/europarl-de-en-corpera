Mr President, my congratulations to the rapporteur, who showed in the Committee on Regional Policy that, with great charm and powers of persuasion, she made a success of this report.
There are a very few points, however, with which I would disagree.
The rapporteur requests a single fund for cross-border projects between the EU and third countries.
I think there is a danger here that funds for programmes which are currently separate might get mixed up with these.
At present we know how much the EU Member States receive and how much non-Member States receive.
That should continue to be the case.
The rapporteur also wants small-scale projects to go ahead without a public tendering procedure, and to make the latter unnecessary.
Although we are all against excessive bureaucracy, it is my opinion that even for small-scale projects the relevant rules of public tendering should be followed.
Lastly, even if some neighbouring countries consider a specific Baltic Sea Programme to be reasonable, my view is that we would need several separate budget headings in future if we were to introduce this.
We should not proceed with such a specific programme.
