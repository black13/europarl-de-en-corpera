Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for common principles of electoral law is a truly historic step forwards.
With this text, we are coming to an agreement about what we are, namely representatives of the people in a Community of united states.
Yet we cannot, and do not wish, to create total uniformity.
This would not be in accordance with the EU's current state of development, nor would it take account of different regional and national characteristics.
We are creating unity with diversity and, at the same time, are taking account of diversity in unity.
This means, firstly, that the legal instrument, which requires a unanimous vote in the Council, should regulate the essential points and not be weighed down with too many details.
Secondly, we are creating the opportunity for European lists which can, and should, be implemented in the elections at the beginning of the 21st century.
That is a job for the parties.
I hope that in the year 2004, each group will jointly put up its key European candidates for election in all Member States.
Thirdly, before enlargement, the candidate countries must be clear about the parameters pertaining to them too.
For Europe, and for the Union, there must proportional representation.
The Treaty of Amsterdam has conferred on the European Parliament the task of working out a draft for joint principles of electoral law.
Today, we are fulfilling that political responsibility.
As from tomorrow, it is the Council's turn.
I should like to express my thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Anastassopoulos.
