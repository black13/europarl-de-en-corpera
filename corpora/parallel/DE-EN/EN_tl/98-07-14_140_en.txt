Mr President, the EU must be there for young people too.
If the EU ignores the needs of young people, the result - at best - will be indifference and, at worst, hostility.
The allocation of ECU 47.5 million to the European Voluntary Service for Young People is, it is true, the minimum required and much less than the European Parliament wanted, but at least it enables the project to continue.
It means that at least a small number of young people without higher education will be able to understand and experience Europe for themselves.
At a time when youth unemployment has reached 15-20 %, this programme is just a drop in the ocean anyway.
In Austria, it has been implemented especially well.
100 young people have already participated in the programme and many others are on the waiting lists.
The programme is not intended to conflict with the voluntary social service year, but is designed to appeal to young people and encourage them to look beyond their own immediate horizons.
In order to make the programme attractive, there must not only be a good range of projects but also good pastoral support.
The criticism that this programme undermines collective agreements is unjustified.
The aim is not to provide cheap labour but to promote personal development and offer young people an opportunity to gain international experience and thus have better opportunities in life.
However, the programme is too limited to have any real weight.
We can of course question the justification of projects such as 'frog conservation in Provence' .
If we bear in mind that 10 million young people in Europe leave school without qualifications, it would be more sensible to increase the budget for the Leonardo programme by 100 %.
This money would benefit apprentices and young people in occupational training.
One cannot help but think that despite all the good intentions, programmes like the European Voluntary Service for Young People smack of tokenism.
