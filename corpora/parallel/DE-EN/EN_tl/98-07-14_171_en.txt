Mr President, Mr Izquierdo Collado, I think that there is actually no fundamental discrepancy between us.
You and I, and the Commission generally, are interested in ensuring that the LEADER programmes which have been agreed for Spain can in fact be implemented.
This must be our first concern, for this will help the private initiatives which want to carry out programmes of this kind.
It is also clear that cofinancing is required and that this cofinancing must be provided in accordance with the regulations governing the LEADER programme.
However, the Commission is flexible in the sense that we do not necessarily demand that these funds be provided exclusively by the Spanish government.
In principle, it is also possible - and this is an internal matter for Spain - for other public bodies to provide this cofinancing.
One thing is clear, however - if no agency is able to provide cofinancing, then the entire LEADER programme is in doubt.
According to the information at our disposal, there is a willingness on the part of other public bodies to provide this cofinancing instead of the Spanish government.
If this takes place, the programmes will then, as I have said, be implemented.
If not, then the programmes cannot be carried out.
That is the situation and the reality, and it lies within the power of the Spanish authorities at various levels to make this decision.
