Madam President, Commissioner, Mrs Dybkjær, it is of course a little sad, considering how hard, how magnificently Lone Dybkjær fought in her report, that the report was originally much better, but we have to accept that, where environmental issues are concerned, small steps forward must be accepted gratefully here in Europe, in the European Parliament.
But perhaps the Member States will then actually grasp these small steps.
That, also, is Europe.
The joint text by the Conciliation Committee notes that the new Member States - Sweden, Finland and Austria - are not required to lower their environmental standards.
So far, so good, and I am very much in agreement with this.
Of course, it would be catastrophic if the Union were seen to be even trying to force Member States to lower their environmental standards.
This would certainly not happen.
But we all read it slightly differently before lunch.
Commissioner, is it not true that you discussed the possibility of checking or rather reviewing whether the Union could not adopt the stricter standards of the three new Member States?
And was it not also discussed that you personally - and here I believe you - would make every effort to support this and to present a result to the House?
I once heard from an official at the Commission that there had not been any really specific discussions with the individual countries.
Nevertheless, it was obvious, the official said, that these countries would not adopt our environmental standards, so there was no point in even trying to discuss it!
A classic case of jumping to conclusions.
I think it is a pity for the Commission.
It think it is a pity, Commissioner - I hold you in the highest regard, and I would have expected a little more from you here.
It is also a pity for the Union, and a pity for the citizens of Europe.
