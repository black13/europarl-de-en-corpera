Madam President, I agree with what Mrs Flemming said.
At both first and second reading, Mrs Dybkj√¶r, we considered your report to be absolutely first-rate and a real ray of hope for the European Parliament.
But was it not precisely for those reasons that we did not agree with the outcome of the Conciliation Committee?
We believe that it is not even worthy of red wine, but at most a glass of seltzer - what remains, after all, of the ten points submitted by Parliament?
Where is the agreement that the White Paper is finally on its way or, even more importantly, that environmental liability is finally being regulated?
For years the Commission has been putting us off, and so it goes on.
I fear it might just happen on twelfth of never.
As Mrs Flemming already said, where is the very clear statement that we will finally look at the regulations in the three new Member States and take very best points over from them?
There should be a whole series of such achievements.
Or where is the management plan for radioactive waste which we, as Parliament, requested?
None of this is in the outcome.
For this reason I believe that Mrs Bjerregard, who has already described us as a Mickey Mouse Parliament in connection with the Fifth Action Programme, will continue to make a joke of Parliament.
I would have liked to know what, in concrete terms, will become of environmental liability, what new points the Commission is planning.
We fear that in environmental terms this result is much too poor, and for this reason we did not vote for it.
