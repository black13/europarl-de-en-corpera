Madam President, I would agree with Mrs Larive.
We discussed this at length, tabled many motions and have had some really good discussions with Mrs van Dijk.
But we did not manage to reconcile our positions on many points with those of the other groups in order to achieve a satisfactory outcome.
I personally, as a pharmacist, am interested in the issue of women and health.
There are, however, many amendments which we simply cannot allow in the report because they have nothing to do with the issue of women's health.
For this reason I support the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party in asking that it be referred back to committee.
