I was disregarded earlier.
I do not know whether it would have turned out that way, but you said that I requested that the quorum be established.
However, in my second point of order I referred to Rule 112(5), because I wanted to know whether there were actually 29 people in the Chamber, and that was before the vote, before Mr Posselt and Mr Bourlanges rushed in.
You did not permit this; if you had, you would have been able to establish the quorum.
This is no longer relevant, but I was referring to something else.
