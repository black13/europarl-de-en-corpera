Madam President, an environmental policy involves pursuing aims.
For human beings the most important aim is to be healthy to an old age.
For this we must see that our environment is in order.
We can achieve this by two methods, either by punishment - and tax is also a punishment, as it were - or by incentives, that is by reducing the burden or achieving tax savings.
It is important within the European Union and worldwide that we achieve common legal bases for tax and uniform labels for fiscal concepts.
Our aim must be to reduce the burden on our citizens in order to have to take away as little as possible of their wages.
One extremely positive example I would like to cite is efficient transport pricing, where the Commission pointed the direction in which we should go.
We must all hope that this efficient transport pricing will be implemented as soon as possible.
