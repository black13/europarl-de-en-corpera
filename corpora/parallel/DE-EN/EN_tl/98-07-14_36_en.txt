Mr President, what we are dealing with here is a much more general problem than simply the composition of a committee.
What we are dealing with is the risk of diminishing political vigilance in the wake of the decision on the euro, where the old dreams of the technocrats suddenly appear again on the agenda and institutional non-regulation changes to institutionalized non-policy.
I have a word of warning for the ECB.
Institutional nirvana is not a safe place to be and there is circumstantial evidence for this.
Firstly, the press are saying that Mr Duisenberg's salary is to be regarded as a state secret.
I hope that he will be able to deny this.
Secondly, there is the procedure for establishing the basic principles of economic policy, where the Monetary Committee has practically worked out all the political aspects, that is to say the primacy of employment policy, the embodiment of monetary policy and the relationship between wages policy and productivity trends, on the basis of the Commission's proposal, thereby rendering the latter incapable of action.
What we need here are institutions which can enter into consultation with the European Parliament, and not just feed it information.
We need a political body which is properly qualified to run the Ecofin and Euro-11 meetings in coordination with the Employment Committee - something like a European economic government.
This will not be achieved by the proposal as it stands, which does nothing more than revive the nightmares of technocracy.
