Mr President, it is a pity that such little use is made of the only existing Community instrument for transnational cooperation between SMEs.
With just 800 EEIGs having been set up since 1989, it is no surprise that there is little or no participation in public contracts.
This low figure assumes even starker significance when one considers that almost 99 % of European businesses are SMEs and that 52 % of jobs are still to be found in this sector.
Anyone who has had a lot of personal contact with SMEs and with micro-enterprises will confirm the rapporteur's remarks, namely that SMEs are completely unaware of the good fortune which could come their way.
The EEIG scheme is an extremely valuable instrument for small businesses in that it allows them to participate in transboundary cooperation within the internal market and even to go so far as to tender for public contracts.
The proposals contained in Mr Tappin's report clearly show what is needed, namely genuinely practical information and concrete measures of support.
The promotion of non-bureaucratic access to public procurement by undertakings engaged in transnational cooperation is very important if the internal market is to have more substance.
An information scheme using every possible means, from personal contact meetings to the use of modern technology, is needed to help overcome the dearth of information and other barriers which exist.
