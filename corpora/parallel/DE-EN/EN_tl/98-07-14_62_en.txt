Mr President, I wish to speak against the amendment and to respond to Mr Lehne by saying that we certainly did do our homework.
We may have - indeed we definitely do have - different opinions on the subject.
The efforts being made to keep families together, which you have criticized, are in keeping with what the European Parliament has readily accepted in other reports, namely in the report on equal rights for gays and lesbians and in the report on human rights - and whether it suits you or not, this was supported by the majority of this House - which stated that there should be no discrimination based on a person's sexual orientation.
It was therefore quite logical that the family in its extended form should be defined in this report.
You say that the electoral rights of third-country nationals in municipal elections go far beyond the rights of EU citizens.
I am sorry, Mr Lehne, but this is simply not true.
EU citizenship gives European citizens the right to vote and to stand as a candidate at European and municipal elections, and there are now calls to extend this to third-country nationals - which incidentally is fully in keeping with what Commissioner Flynn called for in the Year against Racism.
That was last year, and we should not forget it.
I am against the motion.
I am sure that the major coalition in this House will decide differently.
It would have been nice to be voting today on a report which laid down rules for immigration and the rights of immigrants.
(Parliament decided to refer the report back to committee)
