Mr President, Mr President of the European Central Bank, the demise of the old, the EMI, is the birth of the new, the European Central Bank.
For this reason, we here are discussing the policy of the European Central Bank.
I assume that Mr Duisenberg will deny press reports that his salary is being treated as a State secret.
I further assume that we will have a great many more discussions about which monetary policy is really suited to guaranteeing the necessary future investments in Europe and the development of employment that we urgently need.
We must also discuss the acceptable margins of inflation, the problem of deflation, the lack of investment and the problem of the asynchronous course of economic activity that exists not just regionally, but now also socially.
Will we in a couple of years have to republish "A Tale of Two Cities' , in which the Third World expands throughout Europe?
Monetary policy must play its part here too.
Secondly, the complex matter that we will discuss is the question of the democratic integration of the European Central Bank and the ESCB.
I just want to help the ECB on its way with this advice: the institutional nirvana is not a safe place.
