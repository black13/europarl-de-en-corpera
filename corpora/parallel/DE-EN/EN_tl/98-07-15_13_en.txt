Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Schüssel has presented his menu.
What makes Austrian cuisine world famous?
The way it wraps things up!
Apricots in dumpling, schnitzel in breadcrumbs, mince in stuffed peppers.
I am afraid that today Mr Schüssel has only served us with a delicate outer case.
But it is the filling that matters; Europe will not be satisfied with just an empty case!
Europe is hungry for democracy.
More Europe, but less democracy, that is the recipe the chefs, the Heads of State or Government, have in mind for our special diet.
But we should not be slimming down, but feeding ourselves up, to make Europe strong, powerful, robust, courageous and healthy, to restore its joie de vivre .
There is a great appetite for social justice, for fair distribution and participation, for fundamental and human rights, for equality of opportunity, for ecological restructuring and for a policy of peace.
So you cannot just open an old can, we want something fresh!
Mr President-in-Office, do not let them fob you off with something ready-cooked.
Kohl, Chirac and Klima's subsidiarity soup may satisfy a lot of people, but not everyone: this rehashed renationalization makes my stomach turn, and so does all this paternalistic talk about being closer to the citizen.
It is not whipped cream we want, it is citizens' rights.
That is the sort of cooking we like!
Make your presidency a culinary high spot and serve up democracy, because people cannot get enough of that, it is the only thing that cures serious deficiency symptoms.
It is well known that strudel came to Austria via Hungary and Bohemia.
So who, if not Austria, should put enlargement at the top of the menu for the sake of old ties and proximity?
Not as a special offer, mind you, but as the speciality of the house!
But, Mr Schüssel, you cannot stretch it out like strudel pastry until it is ready.
We cannot be indifferent about enlarging Europe, and say we do not give a fig.
So the key challenges in your menu should include enlargement and freedom of movement of workers; key challenges like pushing ahead a genuine employment policy with initiatives for reducing and redistributing working hours, like a coordinated economic policy with initiatives for fiscal harmonization, like the implementation of a long-term environmental policy with initiatives for environmental impact assessments and for withdrawing from nuclear power, and like a home affairs and legal policy aimed at achieving legal certainty rather than extending authority structures under Europol.
The people of Europe will thank you, because they will finally remember why they are supposed to want Europe in the first place.
If democracy is on offer, people's appetite grows.
It is well known that the way to the heart is through the stomach, Mr Schüssel, but not every dish is as tasty as it promises to be.
So please dish up something better!
Europe now needs more than a soufflé full of hot air that collapses as soon as you touch it.
Bon appetit!
