Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when Austria, Sweden and Finland joined in 1995, the European Union committed itself to a more careful consideration of ecological aspects than before.
This is of enormous importance for the economic framework conditions, because only an even playing field permits equal competitive capability.
Thus, we agreed in general then that the more stringent Austrian environmental standards would provisionally continue to apply generally for four more years.
At the same time, a monitoring process was established at Union level.
The objective was to adapt environmental standards, if necessary, to the higher national standards.
These agreements were and still are considered a great environmental policy success both for the new Member States and for the environmental situation in the European Union.
Since then, we have achieved the first success with the benzene content of petrol.
The limit value has been drastically reduced.
In the case of the sulphur content of heating oil, the Austrian limit values have likewise been retained and also the development in the cadmium limits in fertilizers is thoroughly positive, because the limit values not only of Austria, but also of Sweden and Finland, have been extended to the year 2002 on the basis that an objective study is to determine whether cadmium from the soil really can be transferred into the human bloodstream.
If this should be proven, the limit value situation in the European Union is clear.
Currently we still do not have sufficient information about the risks posed by cadmium.
We want an objective analysis of the effects in this area.
