Mr President, animal welfare is a matter of great importance to me.
In Austria, there is a high level of awareness of the importance of how animals are treated, whether we are talking about utility animals, breeding stock or animals for slaughter.
The Austrian presidency will be taking a greater interest in this topic with a view to improving conditions of transportation of animals throughout Europe.
On the subject of animal transportation, I would like to emphasize the necessity of pan-European regulation.
The European Parliament should stake out the political way ahead and set basic conditions.
However, the European Parliament should not approve any regulations that go into too much technical detail.
As politicians, we are elected to set policy and not to displace experts in other professional fields, for example, veterinarians, technicians, etcetera.
Proper transportation of breeding and utility animals is very important for the wellbeing of animals.
However, the transportation of live animals for slaughter must also be carried out under good conditions, because the quality of the meat depends on this.
As producers, we desire good treatment.
However, after the sale has been concluded, the animal no longer belongs to the farmer; the buyer becomes responsible.
It is all very well using modern technology, but please also consider that different types of utility animals have different patterns of behaviour.
In my opinion, it would be virtually impossible to load pigs with a hydraulic loading ramp because they never keep still.
As regards the angle of the ramp, I would like to say that in Austria, we have properly aligned fixed ramps.
To me, it is also crucial for the driver and loading personnel to handle the animal calmly.
