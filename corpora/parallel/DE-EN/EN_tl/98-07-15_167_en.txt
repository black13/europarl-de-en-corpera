Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too have been here almost 10 years and I cannot help thinking about how much we have discussed animal welfare and the amount of paperwork we have created.
Sometimes I really feel there is an awful lot of theory here, but precious little practice.
I would say "yes' to protecting animal welfare, but "no' to Mrs Hautala's proposal on hydraulic loading ramps.
We are creating the impression that there is just the one kind of mass production.
Plenty of practical questions have already been posed.
What about the small-scale farmer who simply wants to transport his animals from A to B?
What about the village butcher; are we not always saying "yes' to local produce?
I would like to put that one to the Greens sometime.
These are animals from detached houses; they have been sleeping in straw, and now we are asking for them to be transported through the place on silver platters.
That does not quite fit in with what Mrs Hautala is proposing here.
Commissioner Bangemann, I also have a problem with how this monitoring is supposed to work.
Is there anything we have not made a decision on here?
Eight-hour transportation, loading and unloading, watering: a lot of this is rather far from actual practice, and for that reason, I would like to suggest here that we should advocate practicable solutions, and you really ought to heed the practical experience of our farming colleagues.
