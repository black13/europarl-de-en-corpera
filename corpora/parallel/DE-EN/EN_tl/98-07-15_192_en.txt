Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too have just received the news that the leader of the Movimiento de Autodeterminaci√≥n de la Isla de Bioko has died in prison, probably as the result of torture inflicted on him.
Let me now say again that the Council will be observing developments in Equatorial Guinea all the more closely and will take every opportunity to point out the high value that must be attached to human rights and democratic principles in that country.
The Council will do everything in its power to avoid any repetition of this in future.
