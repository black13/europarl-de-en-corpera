Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me assure you that we are of course following this difficult situation closely.
Up until now, this information has not been available to us in any detail.
I assume, however, that the Council will be dealing with these developments soon, although we will need more detailed information, and I can assure you that we are keeping a very close watch on affairs, and we will of course be doing everything in our power to improve the situation.
At the present time, I cannot say any more than that, because I cannot, of course, pre-empt the Council and its decisions.
