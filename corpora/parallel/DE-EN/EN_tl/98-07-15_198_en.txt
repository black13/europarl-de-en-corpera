Mr President, Mr Macartney, perhaps I failed to express myself clearly.
I did not say that the Council already has a document in hand.
We are awaiting such a document from the Commission, but what we have asked the Commission to clarify is exactly what instruments Member States have at their disposal to help absorb the impact of these measures.
This document is not yet available.
It will also address the question of the content of these measures, but I cannot give an answer to this at the present stage.
