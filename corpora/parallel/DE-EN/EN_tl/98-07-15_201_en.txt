Mr President, Mr Morris, perhaps I should just say once again that the Member must be well aware that the abolition of duty-free at ports and airports, as well as on ferries and aircraft travelling within the Community, is necessary in order to complete the single market.
In this respect, it has to be emphasized that the abolition of duty-free sales is by no means a new measure.
Those involved in this particular market sector were also granted a five-year transition, which expires in 1999.
This was specifically to enable them to make the necessary adjustments to smooth out the social consequences of the abolition of dutyfree.
The Council is, of course, aware of the fact that the abolition of duty-free in intra-EU ferry and air traffic will lead to employment problems.
The Council therefore eagerly anticipates the results of this study which, as I already mentioned, the Commission will be preparing in the form of a working document on the instruments available to Member States to assist them in dealing with this situation.
Let me stress this again: the Commission is involved and will be presenting this document to us.
The latter will of course contain certain facts and figures.
