Mr President, Mr Cushnahan, allow me to express my thanks to you, too, for your words of encouragement and your warm welcome.
In this context, all I can do is reiterate that the Commission has been asked to prepare the working document, but I cannot say when it will be ready.
I think that question should be addressed to the Commission directly.
Nor can I give you an answer as to its content, that is to say, whether additional funding will be available or not.
I think you should ask the Commission about this.
