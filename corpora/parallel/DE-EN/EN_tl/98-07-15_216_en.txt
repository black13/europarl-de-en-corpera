Mr President, Miss McIntosh, first of all, thank you for your warm welcome.
Secondly, I have to say that your question is rather technical.
I would ask you to allow me to respond to your question in writing, and as regards budget funds, I cannot provide any further information, as I have already explained in answer to the previous question.
