Mr President, Mrs Kokkola, thank you, first of all, for your kind words.
I would like to refer again to something which I mentioned at the beginning of my first answer, but perhaps it did not come across clearly.
The most appropriate body for dealing with such matters is not the Council of the European Union, but UNESCO.
I would, therefore, like to suggest that perhaps the committee of experts you have just proposed should operate under the auspices of UNESCO in tackling this issue.
Let me just underline once more that the Council is not the appropriate body because it has no jurisdiction in this matter.
