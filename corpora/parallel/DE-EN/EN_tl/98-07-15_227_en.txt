Mr President, Mr McCartin, I can at least share with you one communication which I have just received hot off the press.
I am sure you will be pleased to hear this.
The Deputy Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom, Derek Thatchet, went to Nairobi and met with representatives of the SPLA on Tuesday specifically to discuss the matter of the security corridor for aid organizations.
Mr Thatchet then flew on to Khartoum to negotiate there with representatives of the Sudanese government.
The Sudanese rebel organization, the SPLA, has called a unilateral cease-fire in certain areas of the country in order to allow more than a million starving people to receive aid.
The cease-fire in the Federal State of Baralgasal and in parts of the Upper Nile came into effect late on Tuesday evening, according to the SPLA spokesman in Nairobi on Wednesday.
He has since added that the Khartoum government is expected to follow suit.
According to information from the UN World Food Programme (WFP), 1.2 million people in the south of this African state are actually facing starvation.
The people here are suffering primarily as a result of the drought, but also, of course, from the consequences of 15 years of brutal civil war.
I can also add that, since I am responsible, too, for development cooperation, I have discussed this subject myself with the Irish Secretary of State for Development Cooperation.
I know she has gone to great lengths in proposing the sort of solutions for Sudan which helped broker the peace deal in her own country.
