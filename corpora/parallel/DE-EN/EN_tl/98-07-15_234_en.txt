Mr President, I am a Catalan, but as you well know, I cannot submit my supplementary question in the Catalan tongue.
In this case, I will therefore submit it in German.
Madam President, you are only too well aware of how important it is for the EU to remain in touch with its citizens.
At this juncture, I would like to ask whether over the next few months, during the Austrian presidency, the Council will be asking the Commission to come up with any new EU programmes for minorities as well as for unofficial languages.
You mentioned the LINGUA programme.
As you know, we have gained something from the Socrates programme.
However, we must ensure that these official languages, which for the purposes of the European Union are considered to be unofficial, can derive even greater benefit from our efforts in the future.
I wish the Austrian presidency every success.
