Mr President, Mr Vallv√©, first of all, thank you for using German, my mother tongue.
I greatly appreciate that.
I do actually understand Valencian Catalan, not every word, but a little, although I speak it very badly.
As to your question, I can only repeat that the Commission has to take the initiative.
The Council can hardly assign the Commission the task of taking the initiative.
Over the past decade, however - and this is something I wish to elaborate on - considerable changes have been made in a number of areas affecting minority language communities within the European Union.
At national level, decentralization measures, particularly in the fields of teaching and culture, have also led to an increase in activities favourable to a number of minority communities.
In any case, at European level, there is of course a renewed desire to share the benefits of the single market with the less wealthy regions of the Union.
This takes the form of regional aid, such as the financing of infrastructural projects via the Structural Funds, and this aid in turn benefits certain marginal areas and, consequently, communities in prioritized regions.
In many cases, these are also minority regions.
