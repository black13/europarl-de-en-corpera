Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to thank you for your advice to the Commission.
However, I have to say quite openly that the Commission sent us to you.
That is one of the reasons why these questions are being put to you.
We have spoken to Mr Santer and from our point of view we would also be happy to seek a resumption of dialogue with the Commission.
I would like to say quite specifically that in the run-up to the enlargement towards the East, the criteria we are setting for applicant countries as regards minorities are criteria that we often fail to live up to ourselves.
We are therefore of the opinion that something also needs to be done within the EU itself, and it saddens me somewhat to see something of a setback here in that the budget lines for the promotion of minority languages have come under the infamous judgement of the Court.
We have here a list of measures for which new legislation is being created.
Regrettably, the budget line for minority languages is not included here as yet.
I ask you in all sincerity, in your office as presidency of the Council, to take up this matter, because since 1982 the efforts which have been made in this area have been exemplary, and it would be a great pity if these were now to be wasted.
