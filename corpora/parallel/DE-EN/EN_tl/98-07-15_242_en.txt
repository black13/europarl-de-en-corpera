Madam President, allow me to say how heartening it is to see you in this position.
My question is as follows: do you not agree that it would be intrinsically more correct if we were also to address the issue of political representation when dealing with problems of nationality and language, because without the political representation, no regulation will ever be fully effective?
And do you not agree that when it comes to the rights of these ethnic minorities, there should be a special focus on the political representation of these groups, because - the way I see it - the system which has been adopted in Belgium constitutes the best solution.
If we look at the German Cantons of Mr Grosch, who was elected with 16 000 votes, while I - as has been pointed out to me - needed 980, 000 votes to get elected, then I consider it quite fair and equitable that we should ultimately recognize that there is more to this than counting heads.
I shall finish in a moment; just a few more words, Mr President.
I just want to say that groups really are as important as individuals as regards rights within the Community.
Thank you very much, Mr President.
(Laughter)
