Mr President, Mr von Habsburg, I too am delighted to be addressing you in your new capacity.
Perhaps in this instance I can make an exception and give a personal answer.
Personally, I think you are quite right.
Of course this matter is something which we should look into further, and we can get our cue from Article 128 - which I cited earlier - namely the first section, which states that the Community shall contribute to the flowering of the cultures of the Member States while respecting their national and regional diversity and at the same time bringing the common cultural heritage to the fore.
As I indicated earlier, however, it is up to the Commission to table a proposal here.
Then the Council can become involved too.
