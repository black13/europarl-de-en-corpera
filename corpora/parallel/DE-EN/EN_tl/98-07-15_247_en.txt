Mr President, Mr Ephremidis, I am sure you are just as familiar with the Treaties as I am.
As you know, I am speaking here of Article 128(5), which quite clearly lays down the right of the Commission to take the initiative.
I believe that all the other procedures are of an informal nature.
Of course, it is possible to approach the Commission informally, but the basic formal right to take the initiative lies with the Commission.
There is nothing I can do about that.
