Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, as Vice-President of the inter-parliamentary delegation for relations with Slovakia, I am constantly involved in intensive discussions as to how minority rights are actually handled within the European Union of 15 and how they will be handled in the applicant countries.
The questions are always the same: is there an evaluation?
How are minority rights developing within the various states?
What model should really be adopted as the best practice?
Are we in a position to produce exemplary projects and say that these really work, that this is the way things should be, and can these models be compared with one another?
