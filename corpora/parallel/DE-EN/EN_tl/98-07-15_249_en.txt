Mr President, Mr RÃ¼big, I would like to add the following: all Member States of the European Union naturally operate on a democratic basis, fully uphold human rights and meet all the criteria that we are imposing on some of the prospective Member States.
You are aware of the Copenhagen criteria.
These include the process of full democratization, that is to say, democracy.
This naturally goes hand in hand with the effective protection of minority rights.
That is the basis of the agreement.
This is also the starting point for renewed political dialogue with Slovakia, for example, a process which I personally am very much involved with in that country.
