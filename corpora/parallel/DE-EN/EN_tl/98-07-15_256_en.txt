Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report by my friend, Andrea Manzella, on the implementation of the Amsterdam Treaty deals with the most important task of the European Parliament, apart from its budgetary powers and appointment of the Commission, that is, joint legislation at European level.
We must be aware of the dimensions of what we have now achieved in terms of codecision: before Maastricht, there was nothing, after Amsterdam, 75 % of all legal acts are decided jointly by the Council and Parliament.
However, this great success should not distract us from the subject areas which still remain open: agriculture, competition, taxes, Economic and Monetary Union, foreign trade and social dialogue.
If these six areas are not included, the European democratic deficit will not have been eliminated.
We now find ourselves in a new situation, the Council must first of all get used to the fact that it no longer has the last word.
But the European Parliament must also change its work fundamentally and concentrate greatly on legislation.
For this, a measure of self-criticism is necessary.
We can no longer speak on all topics by means of resolutions and urgencies.
We will now be involved less with ardent appeals than with the concrete work of integration which will determine and, I think, give new impetus to, the everyday work of the European Parliament.
Mr Manzella's proposals therefore point in the right direction.
