Mr President, miracle weapons have never lived up to their reputation.
This was so in the ancient world, but it is also the case in German mythology.
One or two examples of the many show this clearly.
When tested, the Achilles heel did not really prove to be strong, and even miracle weapons in our century proved to be an illusion, which is fortunate for Europe and for democracy in the European Union.
In this respect, it is good that the supposed miracle weapon of closer cooperation, of which some promised so much prior to the beginning of the last Turin Intergovernmental Conference, was not actually launched in Amsterdam.
In this respect, it is good that Mr Frischenschlager's very sensible report - and it is for that reason that it is such a good one - shows with great clarity the limited scope and the limited efficiency and desirability of this new form of variable geometry.
Closer cooperation in its European form with a compulsory field of activities for the Commission also, with democratic participation of the European Parliament, and with constitutional control by the Court of Justice is essential.
Anything else would have been detrimental, after all.
The main point made by the Frischenschlager report, therefore, is that the laborious process of European decision-making in the first pillar, or at least in accordance with the first pillar, cannot be replaced.
Shortened forms of this laborious dialogue, short, simple ways to achieve great new European solutions do not and will not exist.
This is why we should remember that the magic potion only works for the Gauls, for Asterix and Obelix.
We Europeans, on the other hand, are required to recreate our common Europe laboriously each day.
The only formula which leads to success is to never stand still, and we heard in the debate this morning on the Austrian presidency how this formula is used again and again.
We must build our common Europe together.
