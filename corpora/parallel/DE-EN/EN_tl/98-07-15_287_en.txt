Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent and open report on this issue.
Allow me, first of all, to observe that this morning, when the Austrian ViceChancellor presented Austria's programme for the presidency of the European Union, I was proud to be Austrian.
Now I am slightly irritated.
In contrast to what was said by Mr Pirker - who today created a Fortress Austria, a Fortress Europe -, this morning we spoke about the enlargement of the European Union, with all the spirit that belongs to it and all the political perspectives associated with it, with certain conditions and transitional arrangements, of course.
In the preliminary phase, however, we are introducing purely discriminatory measures and are not even in a position to integrate workers and their families from third countries.
We are applying a double standard but, apart from that, the proposal concerns a gradual implementation of these measures.
I considered this to be only practical.
On the one hand, we in the European Union talk about the freedom of movement of goods, we want to strengthen it and implement it.
Where it is a question of the freedom of movement of people, of the social rules and measures involved, we obstruct it.
Where any kind of discriminatory rules are concerned, we disgrace ourselves.
This must not be allowed.
I assume that tomorrow reason will prevail and we will be able to take the initial steps in this direction, as otherwise in many cases our deepening process will succeed only to a very poor extent and this should not and cannot be the case.
Excuse my rather emotional outburst, but that is how I feel today.
