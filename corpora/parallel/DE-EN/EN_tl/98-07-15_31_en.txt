Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, I wish to thank you for mentioning a policy for children, because our children are the future of Europe.
Legal maternity protection, two years' maternity leave, child benefit, a legal ban on hitting children: these are things I would like to see for all children in Europe.
Children need a healthy environment.
I am convinced that the Austrian presidency will push ahead with integrating environmental objectives into all areas of policy, including animal welfare.
Leonardo da Vinci, Francis of Assisi: it was always the truly great who lent their voice to dumb animals.
The European Union is an immense economic power, and we are proud of that.
Yesterday, the great spirit of Europe blew through this country: liberty, equality and fraternity.
We are proud of that, too.
However, the moral quality of any society can be judged by how it treats its weakest: the old, the sick and the young.
Here we see the soul of Europe, born out of a Christian understanding that every person is unique and inimitable, and I hope that the Austrian presidency will give a hint of the soul of our great continent.
