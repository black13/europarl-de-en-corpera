Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, the number one question for this autumn is how to create jobs.
The answer could not be simpler: you just have to produce products and offer services that people want to buy.
How do you achieve that?
You have to invest in education and training, in life-long learning.
In this case I would suggest - and Mrs Flemming has already touched on this - that the Leonardo programme should receive at last 100 % extra funding.
At present we have given this programme 0.1 % of the Community budget.
If we increased this to 0.2 %, we could make an important contribution to making employment interesting and integrating young people into the world of employment.
What else do we need?
We need fiscal coordination, and we need harmonization of the legal basis for taxes.
We should not worry so much about tax rates, because what we need here is a market, not a finance ministers' cartel, but a reasonably priced service for our citizens.
We need as few taxes as possible, but we need a proper basis: we do not need 163 different value added tax regulations, but rather a definition of tax fraud and many other issues.
What else do we need?
A social dialogue!
In other words, we need to talk with each other.
We have too many problems just to debate them theoretically, we need to sit down and talk with the practitioners.
