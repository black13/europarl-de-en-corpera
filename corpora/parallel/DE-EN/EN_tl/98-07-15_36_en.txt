Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, if you are looking for work, I have two more subjects for you.
One is the Fifth Framework Programme for Research, where we are talking about the derisory sum of ECU 15 or 16 billion.
We must get this work done as quickly as possible or else the Commission will not be able to make the funding available next year.
That means we need to know what is available to us before the decision on the budget.
And that puts both you and us - because we have to work together on this - under pressure for time.
I am assuming that the conciliation procedure will start as soon as possible in September and will then reach an outcome.
The second job I have for you, or perhaps this is on your agenda anyway, is a tough one: the climate summit in Buenos Aires.
Although Buenos Aires is a long way from Europe, it still concerns us.
We came very well out of the last climate summit in Kyoto.
The Europeans actually demonstrated their lead in this field.
That was recognized and it also made an important contribution to creating a feeling of cohesion and resurgence in Europe.
The agreements that were signed then, or which were agreed to, have scarcely been observed.
As a physicist I do not just look at such agreements, but I also take measurements or have others take them, and I can see that we are producing more CO2 today than a year ago.
And so it goes on!
That means that we need a strategy, and Buenos Aires is a good opportunity for it.
The presidency is also an opportunity for you to demonstrate that you are capable not just of words, but also of deeds.
I wish you luck for your presidency, and I hope that we shall be able to work together.
