Mr President of the Council, first and foremost I would like to thank you for the specific and clear speech you have given on a subject in which the real point has so often been missed.
I see signs in this that it is not in vain that Austrian history has played a significant role in Kosovo.
Because Austria means a great deal to the Albanians.
I ask you, therefore, to use this Austrian prestige to bring peace, where Austria in its time also brought peace.
But I would also like to say that it is important for us to pursue a much clearer policy for once and I am grateful that you have started this process.
The most important thing, however, is that we support Mr Rugova, as that is the political solution that we must seek.
I am, therefore, very happy that my group has submitted Mr Rugova's name for the next Sakharov Prize.
We must do everything to strengthen the position of Mr Rugova which, unfortunately, has been betrayed by politics, including those of the European Union, in recent months, even years.
The peace-loving groups have not been supported there.
It is understandable that we have had difficulties.
In this context, I wish you every success in your task.
