Mr President, in the vote on Article 2 you said that Amendment No 8 by the Green Group was invalid.
In my opinion, this is not the case, because the preceding amendments that we accepted refer to the setting up of regional constituencies.
The amendment by the Greens, however, aims to add something to Article 2, namely to obtain compensation for the system of proportional representation if there are regional constituencies.
For this reason I ask for a vote to be taken again on Amendment No 8.
