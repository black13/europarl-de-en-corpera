Mr President, I have no objections, because that is the wording in normal usage, even by the Commission.
I only ask urgently that a vote be taken on Amendment No 9 in any case, as the term 'revenue-neutral' appears here.
With this amendment, we want to make it very clear that environmental expenditure, regardless of where and how it is spent, must not under any circumstances increase the tax quota; instead, the money must be returned to the citizens.
We must vote on this!
