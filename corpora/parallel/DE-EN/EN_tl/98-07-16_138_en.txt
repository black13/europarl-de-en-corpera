Mr President, President Lukashenko is taking his self-inflicted isolation of Belarus to excess.
After the elected representatives of the dissolved parliament, the independent media and young people, it is now the western ambassadors which Lukashenko has singled out for bullying as his personal enemy.
The international community did not act until its own people were affected.
It was very slow in realizing that Lukashenko was not prepared to respect international rules in Europe and that the country's only hope of returning to democracy is through support for the opposition, for the opposition is the only thing on which we can pin our hopes.
The visa ban has been the only significant step taken by the Council.
It was, however, also long overdue.
The effect has been amazing.
Just imagine, the population has now realised who is to blame for the situation in which it finds itself.
It is not the people, not the West, but those in power in the government.
A small instrument with an astounding effect!
Now comes the task of ensuring that this work is continued consistently, in other words that Lukashenko must be made to cooperate with the OSCE monitoring group.
He must be made to give the TACIS programme the green light so that finally there can be an end to the suffering of the civil population.
He must be made to accept that his mandate only runs until next year and that he must make preparations for free and fair elections.
In this context I as you, Mr Brittan: what is the Commission prepared to do, and what conditions do you intend to propose to the Council for the lifting of the visa ban?
