Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Togo is a symbol of cooperation between Europe and Africa.
The Lomé Convention always has been and still is a milestone in this kind of cooperation.
This has made it all the more painful for us all that it was only with great difficulty that we were able to hold the last but one meeting of the ACPEU Joint Assembly in Togo and to accept Togo's invitation.
A number of Members of this House had particular problems making the decision to travel to Togo.
There is a lesson to be drawn from what has happened in Togo and that is that we should not necessary believe empty promises.
For the highly embarrassing personality cult manifested at the last meeting of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly showed all too well the direction in which things were developing.
Although those in power were prepared to hold elections, they had undoubtedly also started looking for the loopholes which, if the result went in a direction they did not like, they could use as a sort of emergency brake.
In our resolution - as Mrs André-Léonard has already mentioned - we have indicated that the media were also manipulated to a large extent.
May I, however, remind you all that we are not so very far away from such things in Europe.
We just have to look at the sort of media manipulation which has been visited upon the electorate in the so-called election campaigns in Serbia and elsewhere.
I am pleased that cooperation with Togo has not yet been resumed.
I believe that recent events show that the resumption of this cooperation should not be hurried.
Several amendments to this text have been tabled.
I would simply like to explain that I think Amendments Nos 4 and 5 are acceptable, one because it refers back to Article 366a, the Mauritius resolution.
Amendment No 5 is actually superfluous since I believe it goes without saying that we will receive the relevant report.
