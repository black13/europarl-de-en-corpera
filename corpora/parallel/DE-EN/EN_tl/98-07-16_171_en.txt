Madam President, I can endorse much of what Mr Bertens has said, for the situation in Sudan really is a sad and never-ending story.
This I know as a rapporteur in the ACP-EU Joint Assembly.
The problem has been the same for many years now.
We simply cannot get things moving.
The parties are not prepared to agree on a peaceful solution.
There is a danger that it will become a Thirty Years War.
I believe that the Council is right in supporting the IGAD and in endeavouring to engineer things so that we can send another ministerial mission to Khartoum and Nairobi and put a stop to the fighting.
As Mr Bertens rightly said, according to newspaper reports the SPLA has declared that it is ready to stop the fighting for three months.
I hope this happens as it is the only chance to help the people.
With the terrible drought it is already very late anyway.
Then we must work to secure peace as quickly as possible.
If we manage to achieve peace, then all the measures required to help the people there can be carried out calmly.
Even if peace is secured it will not be easy to solve the problems there, as it will not be possible to make good the damage which has been caused there and to restore the structures which have been destroyed over night.
I am afraid that even once the conditions are right there will still be an awful lot of work to do before the families which have been broken up can be reunited and everything else which needs to be done can be done.
Let us do everything we can to ensure that these conditions are created.
Then we can start to rebuild.
That is the first step.
