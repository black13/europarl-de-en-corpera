) Madam President, in the joint resolution we emphatically condemn the most recent acts of violence against the Georgian people.
The resolution also expresses our full support for the President of Georgia who has set in motion a process of political and economic reforms.
This process includes the strengthening of internal stability which has already made progress in the past.
The peaceful solution of the crisis in Abkhazia is an important prerequisite for further consolidation and an important condition for the stabilization of the country.
We regret that fighting started in the region again in May, bringing with it deaths and hundreds of thousands of refugees.
In order to continue the policy of reform in Georgia, further peaceful, political solutions to the conflict in Abkhazia must be found.
We therefore urgently advise the parties to take an active role in the UN peace process, and have reiterated this in point 2 of the resolution in which we call for adherence to the 1994 Moscow Agreement on a cease-fire and separation of forces and the 1998 cease-fire protocol, as well as to the obligation to refrain from all use of force.
This plea goes out to both sides, and I very much hope that the resolution will be passed unanimously in this form.
