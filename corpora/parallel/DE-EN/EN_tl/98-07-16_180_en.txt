Madam President, the conflict in Abkhazia is one of those conflicts which always fill us with concern because, after the military debacle, hatred amongst the population is so deep that it splits it, and efforts to secure peace progress very slowly.
The return of families to Gali was based on the great hope that it would finally be possible to bring the conflict under control.
The fighting has now destroyed this hope.
But what is the EU doing to improve the possibilities of a return to peace?
Sometimes it is necessary to proceed in small steps.
That is why the Council of Europe has endeavoured to implement a programme of confidence-building measures, such as the Ertoba Radio Company project.
To date not one single Member State has offered its support for this measure.
What is needed is a few small projects to restore understanding amongst the population.
For this reason we are calling upon the Council to finance measures designed to build confidence amongst the population and to devote considerably greater attention to this.
