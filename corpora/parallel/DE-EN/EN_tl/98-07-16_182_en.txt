Madam President, Commissioner, this resolution contains everything it possibly can about human rights, and the European Parliament has always made its views on human rights very clear.
I believe that we should look at the issue of human rights in a country with some reference to the historical context of that country.
If we look at the whole history of Vietnam, we can see that there is one part of Vietnam where we have become accustomed to seeing human rights infringed and abused and another part where - in our version - this did not happen in the same form at least until the 1970s.
Since then and since the war in Vietnam, we have more or less blocked this country from our memories, banished it from our consciences and it is time that we shook these consciences awake again, faced up to what is really going on there and made it clear here in the European Parliament that we cannot remain silent if such things, if such crimes are really taking place there.
This is why this resolution is so important.
It is good that it has come here to the Parliament, that it attempts to highlight the situation so that in the future a relationship between the European Union and Vietnam will be possible.
