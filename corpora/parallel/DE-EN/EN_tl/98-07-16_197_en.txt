Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the earthquake in Turkey really is a large-scale natural disaster - 150 dead, 1 500 seriously injured, thousands of buildings damaged -, and it is both good practice and vitally necessary that we express our solidarity not only in words, but also in deeds, in the form of aid.
For this earthquake occurred in the south of Turkey, in a region which is highly dependent on tourism.
The first reports only a few weeks after this devastating earthquake reveal that tourist bookings have dropped drastically.
Turkey has reported a drop of over 40 % in this heartland of European tourism which welcomes almost 5 million European tourists every year.
So it is a disaster which goes beyond personal damage, beyond family suffering.
It is a disaster which goes beyond the physical damage which has been caused on the ground.
It is a disaster which directly affects the livelihoods of several million Turks, and therefore we need to provide rapid assistance of a practical nature.
Above all the European Union needs not only to express its solidarity as we are doing here in Parliament - and I am delighted that the Greek members have also done this - but to finally fulfil its obligations under the customs cooperation agreement with Turkey.
It is we - not the European Parliament, but rather the European Union - who have blocked a considerable percentage of the payments due to Turkey to date.
We have failed to act in accordance with the agreement and I should like to take this opportunity, in addition to expressing my solidarity with the victims, to call upon the Commission, together with the Austrian presidency, to put an end once and for all to the blockade on financial aid to Turkey so that we really can provide some practical assistance.
In the same vein, we also need to make the necessary provisions, of course, and here I agree unreservedly with the two previous speakers who have seen this as their task.
