Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in light of the sensitivity of the subject we are dealing with, it was in my view a wise decision to leave open to the Council and the Commission the detail of the text of the resolution specifying the means by which they intend to exert pressure on the relevant institutions and governments to effect the restitution of property belonging to Holocaust victims to those persons who are legally entitled to it.
However, precisely because that is the case, because this openness was necessary, I should now like to draw attention to and underline what Mr De Giovanni has already said.
There is in this case both a moral and a legal imperative for action.
The moral imperative consists in the fact that the Holocaust has become a universal example of the flouting of human dignity and human rights.
Such behaviour must be condemned, and we must therefore act accordingly.
The legal obligation consists in the fact that every legal system makes provision for compensation for damage suffered by a victim or restitution of that of which he has been deprived.
However, I would like to conclude with a reference to a historical imperative for action by the European Union.
I hope that during the next legislative period, as a result of enlargement, Auschwitz will become part of the Union.
It is therefore important that the European Union is quite clear about exactly what this means for it.
