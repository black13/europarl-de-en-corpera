Mr President, in its original form the regulation under discussion here failed to gain the desired level of success in all quarters since some airline companies withheld the necessary information from the relevant parties.
However, a protective regulation makes sense only if the people to be protected are also aware of their rights.
A situation must be avoided in which airline companies are enabled to evade their obligations by intentionally failing to provide information or by disinformation.
For this reason, above all, the proposal to display a notice at the flight desk bearing details of how to obtain information on the relevant rules and regulations is to be welcomed.
However, I imagine that it would also make sense in the interests of comprehensive and customer-oriented information if passengers were also to be informed of the higher compensatory amount in the same way, as that would improve the information considerably.
Any amendment which obliges the airline companies to present each passenger on request with a copy of the relevant regulations would meet with my full support.
