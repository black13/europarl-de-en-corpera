Mr President, my thanks to Mr Howitt for this report.
There was really nothing more he could have made of it, given that the European Parliament was consulted at such a late stage.
I must say quite honestly that I am very disappointed that Mrs Wulf-Mathies is not here.
Could it be that she is avoiding this discussion?
The point of contention is whether or not the guidelines are binding.
This point of contention is being carried forward into the new regulation.
Most revealing in this respect is the rapporteur's question in the explanatory statement.
The guidelines are basically nothing more than a paper tiger.
They are ignored by the Member States.
The Commission is not pressing for them to be used as guidelines for adherence to European objectives or European cohesion policy.
This must be seen as particularly critical given that it is intended that in the future the guidelines should form the centrepiece of European structural policy and that they should then almost become the core of a Structural Fund regulation to ensure that it remains focussed on the issue of European cohesion policy.
In the new regulation the Commission has indeed reallocated certain tasks.
That was a very sensible move, but if it restricts itself to setting a framework and to monitoring, it needs the guidelines for support.
If these guidelines have no central significance, there will be no European cohesion policy.
This represents a very, very dangerous threat capable of undermining its very foundations.
We can only achieve sustainable development, equal opportunities and employment if they are a joint aim.
This joint aim also needs common paths, even if they are travelled differently in the various regions.
For this reason it is most important that we continue to discuss this matter intensively.
We know that many Member States do not want guidelines.
That is responsibility enough to make us develop them into a central instrument here.
