Mr President, each day every European citizen becomes more aware that electronic commerce is the commerce of the future.
Solving the associated problems in the field of legal security will be a determining factor in the acceptance of electronic communication by the citizens, but it will also be a precondition for the equality of legal status of digital and conventional signatures.
The rapporteur has given us a comprehensive account of these problems and pointed us in the right direction.
Solutions appear to be possible for both the problems of authentication and integrity.
In my view it is, in fact, the question of confidentiality which will prove difficult to resolve.
However, the speed of technical development in the field of electronics suggests that satisfactory methods will soon be available.
On one hand these will have to meet the requirements of day-to-day use and of data protection, on the other they must not hinder the fight against crime.
It is my view, however, that we should dispense with legal access rules.
