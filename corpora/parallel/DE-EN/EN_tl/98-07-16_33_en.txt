Madam President, I could almost repeat my contributions to the discussion last year word for word.
Every year we receive more and more petitions, even though a high percentage of the people of the European Union do not even know that they have the right to submit petitions on Community issues to the European Union.
In addition to leaflets, the use of new media could be used to inform the citizens of Europe of their democratic rights.
To the disappointment of the petitioners, the processing of petitions to the final outcome takes too long.
The Committee on Petitions has optimised its procedures.
In my view, cooperation with the civil servants in the Commission has improved considerably.
As has already been said, in most cases the problem lies with the Council, that is, with the Member State to be consulted in each case.
It requires real patience to obtain an answer.
It often takes months, frequently there is no answer at all and sometimes it is only the pressure of the Commission instituting proceedings which moves the Member State to act.
It is impossible to avoid the impression that, contrary to the obligation enshrined in the Maastricht Treaty, individual Member States are not taking the rights of petitioners very seriously.
I personally find it gratifying that the number of petitions taking action against failures to apply or to implement European environmental law has dropped considerably in the period covered by the report.
This could be taken to show that Member States are now taking the environmental directives more seriously.
A high percentage of the petitions relate to social issues and to migrant workers in particular.
Although the coordinating directive 1408 is positive, it often offers no help in resolving injustices.
In this area, in particular, the Council must show greater understanding to ensure that freedom of movement does not create disadvantages.
Here I should mention Mrs Weiler's report on which we will be voting this afternoon.
