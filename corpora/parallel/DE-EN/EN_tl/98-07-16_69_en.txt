Madam President, I voted against the Evans report because I believe that it was a very bad decision on the part of Parliament.
We demand the recognition of minority rights and regional languages at all levels.
We demand it at Council level, as we did in the Maij-Weggen/Dury report.
We demand it from associated states, but we do not demand it of ourselves.
In our Rules of Procedure we have failed to draw the obvious conclusions of what we demand of others.
The Evans report is poor because, on one hand, it fails to distinguish between our recognized regional languages and other languages.
Secondly, I do not quite understand the point of the summarised translation for it can only mean that the petition is not read in the original language.
And if it is not read then there is no point in giving anyone the right to submit it.
I have the feeling that this is an attempt to mislead us and I should therefore like to make it quite clear that I believe we should stick to our official languages, but that between the official languages and all the other languages we also have the regional languages which we must secure and protect.
