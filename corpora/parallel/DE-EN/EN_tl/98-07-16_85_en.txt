Madam President, I am very pleased that we have finally been able to adopt a clear stance on matters in Kosovo with a very large majority.
Unfortunately, however, it has to be said that this is really something we should have done two or three years ago.
Then we might really have been able to achieve an internationally guaranteed, far-reaching solution based on autonomy, just like the one we are calling for today.
For years we ignored Mr Rugova's peaceful line by doing nothing, and now it makes sense that the Kosovo Albanians should be trying to escape with their bare lives.
And that is exactly what is happening.
We have quite simply acted too late.
However, I am pleased that the Austrian presidency seems to represent a turning point in this matter.
Mr Schüssel was the first President of the Council to give a clear and forwardlooking message on Kosovo.
For years we have been pressing for an EU office in Pristina.
We were always told it was not possible.
Within a few days Mr Schüssel had set up a representative office and I am pleased that the image of Europe we are presenting in Kosovo at the present time is Mr Schüssel's image of Europe.
