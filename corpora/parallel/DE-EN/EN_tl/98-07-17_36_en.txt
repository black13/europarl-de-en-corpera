Mr President, first I would like to thank the rapporteur for his consistent action in the fight against crime.
The adversary, however, is "organized crime' and should not be underestimated.
It is an adversary which a priori has the upper hand due to a lack of legal constraints and against which the Union must arm itself with the best legal weapons.
That is why we must join the rapporteur in ruing the lack of concrete proposals in the measure submitted for improving legal provisions in the Member States.
Given the rising crime rates, I find the reservations shown difficult to understand.
Even in Austria, where the matter is regulated more or less along the lines advocated by the rapporteur, I have for this very reason criticized provisions which I felt went too far in dispensing with what we refer to as levies on enrichment and forfeiture, as counter-productive and mafiafriendly, precisely because it is swift action against the financial proceeds of criminal organizations which is effective.
That is why we welcome the proposed improvements.
