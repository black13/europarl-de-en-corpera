Mr President, continuing training for officials is important.
Permanent training and continuing training are at the root of efficient action.
We urgently need to improve infrastructures, especially that of the investigation authorities.
But research into investigation methods and information on groups of persons and organizations are equally important.
However, are we a good example in our own field?
What is our track record on fighting crime in and around our Parliament.
People are constantly being mugged, our offices are broken into and things are stolen from our desks.
I think we need to review the ECU 16.7 million spent on security for Parliament.
What is our track record on cooperation with the French, Belgian and Luxembourg authorities as far as our own security is concerned?
