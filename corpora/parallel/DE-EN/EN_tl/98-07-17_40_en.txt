Mr President, may I ask the rapporteur a question on this point?
Mr Blokland maintains that this would be overstepping the contractual mark.
If you look closely at the amendment, it contains a proposal to the effect that the Member States agree between themselves to cooperate in this way.
Perhaps the rapporteur could give an opinion on this?
