Mr President, the Pope recently visited Vienna and said that we should be talking of Europeanization rather than enlargement towards the East.
I think that these cross-border training exchanges could be used as a model.
Cooperation in training is extremely important, because people in the profession, teachers, pupils and students, have the opportunity to get to know each other and to learn from each other.
I, too, asked the Council for an increase in Leonardo funds on Wednesday during the presidency debate.
As Mr Elchlepp rightly pointed out, we have no sympathy with reductions because funds within the European Union are already so stretched.
We need a 100 % increase in these funds if we are to be able to do justice to these tasks.
