Mr President, Mr von Habsburg is quite right.
Fishing, like all primary forms of production, is a central aspect of the ecologically destructive and unfair world order in which we unfortunately live.
However, I would like to add straight away that, if we are to overturn this unfair world order, we must constantly ask ourselves if we are part of the problem.
The European Union and its fishing policy are part of the problem, despite the scraps from the table which fall to the poor countries.
A step could have been made towards overcoming the situation by accepting Amendment No 7 proposed by the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party, because even the best fishing agreement cannot function without controls, which is why I regret that this amendment was not accepted and wish to explain why our group agreed to it.
