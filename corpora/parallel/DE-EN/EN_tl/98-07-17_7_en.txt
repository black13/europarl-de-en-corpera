Madam President, I have just one comment to make on the subject of punishing officials: the poor people in the cash office are not to blame.
If anyone should be punished it is those at the top, whose faces are never seen.
That is what we should be demanding.
And a number of other elected officials should be punished; I do not mean you, but someone else.
