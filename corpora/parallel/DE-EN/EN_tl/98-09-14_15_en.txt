Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I will be very brief and thus hope to make up some of the extra time which my colleagues have previously taken.
First of all, I should like to warmly congratulate the rapporteur, who unfortunately is not with us here today, on his excellent report.
He has really done a very good job.
I should merely like to endorse his criticism of the Council.
We do not want anything impossible, but we do want safe aircraft, even if they come from non-EU Member States.
This has after all been regulated since 1992 for the Member States.
We do not want excessive bureaucracy, but we do want information to be exchanged and the general public to be able to access information.
None of this is going too far - our concern is to achieve something useful for Europe's citizens, namely the highest possible standard of safety.
The Group of the European People's Party therefore supports all the amendments from the Committee on Transport, as we have already done in the committee.
We think that a sensible compromise has been found here.
At the same time, we expect the Commission to vigorously support these amendments, which express the continued will of the House, in the talks with the Council at second reading.
The Council would also be well advised to adopt our amendments.
