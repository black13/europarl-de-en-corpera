Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the design directive which we are talking about today has a path of trial and tribulation behind it, but it is not yet out of the woods.
The result of conciliation between Parliament and the Council has left open some important questions.
Against this background, I should like to thank my colleague, Mr Medina Ortega, on behalf of my group for the steadfastness with which he has represented the concerns of Parliament before the Council and the Commission.
His steadfastness was particularly evident during the struggle for the so-called repairs clause.
We only have to look at the motor vehicles sector to recognise the importance of this detail.
The European Parliament has found a balance between the interests of the car industry, spare parts manufacturers and consumers.
It would have proved the benefit of the European Union to its citizens if the Council had agreed to our proposal.
It failed because of the egoism of individual Member States, which is not good evidence of Europe's ability to solve problems.
The result of conciliation which we agree to with bad grace is no solution.
It merely postpones a solution.
We shall therefore only agree to this legislative standstill because nothing will become worse through it, and because we assume that it will still be possible to achieve a satisfactory ruling on spare parts.
This must prevent monopolisation - which restricts competition - and at the same time secure inexpensive repairs for consumers with spare parts of their choice.
The Commission has the job of making this objective achievable in the next seven years.
Commissioner, we in Parliament and my group in particular will keep a close watch on how and whether this is happening.
