Mr President, Commissioner, I have not understood the negative undertone which has come from the far left wing.
We have achieved progress and something positive here.
The fact is that 180 million car drivers and motorbike riders can breathe a sigh of relief, since the Conciliation Committee of the European Parliament has been able to prevent expensive times for them for the immediate future.
Thanks are due above all to the negotiators in this Conciliation Committee.
All independent garages and the market in spare parts with all its employees, the many small and medium-sized enterprises, can also breathe a sigh of relief, however.
Through the clear position it has adopted - not least in our plenary discussions - the European Parliament has prevented big car companies from dictating prices, which would have been the consequence if we had agreed to this proposal.
The monopoly which would have been created indirectly will therefore not come about, so the high insurance premiums which would also have arisen will not take effect.
Businesses will not go bankrupt and jobs will not be destroyed.
I sympathise with producers, because design costs money.
We must therefore find a solution which also takes into account the protection of designs and a commensurate payment for the designer.
In future there must be a free market, however, with replication under specific conditions.
Three years now remain in which to find a suitable solution.
I believe that what we have achieved is a success for our citizens, consumers and the many small and medium-sized enterprises, because in future there will be original and after-market parts and independent garages and dealerships side by side, in the interest of consumers, employees and many ordinary people.
This is a successful outcome, due to the persistence of Parliament's representatives.
