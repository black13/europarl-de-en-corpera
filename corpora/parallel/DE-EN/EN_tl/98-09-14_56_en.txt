Mr President, I am extremely surprised, Mr Bangemann, that you are exploiting this joint debate so as to put the statement on Echelon at the end, thereby actually avoiding a debate on it.
The House is holding a joint debate, and I should like to hear two statements from you.
I am quite staggered that you do not find all this alarming.
You do not seem particularly concerned about the existence of a system of electronic surveillance which allows eavesdropping on telephone conversations - in fact the whole network of telecommunications between the citizens of Europe - without any protection of fundamental rights, any courts of law, parliamentary control or data protection.
This is a massive intrusion upon people's privacy which bears the hallmark of totalitarianism.
I am quite amazed by your restraint.
After all, you come from a country in one part of which a system of injustice has just been overcome and where general spying on citizens was the most significant feature.
Five English-speaking countries, including an EU Member State, are now helping to support and operate this system which originated in the USA.
Apparently, it has now been secretly decided under the third pillar, outside the Council meeting, to set up a similar system in the EU in cooperation with the FBI.
The EU sees itself as a system of values based on fundamental rights and human rights.
We believe that spying on its citizens and putting them at the mercy of spies is totally incompatible with this perception.
It may be that the American system of justice is no longer even able or willing to protect the human dignity and basic rights of its own President, according to the latest developments.
However, such an attack on the privacy of our citizens should be firmly resisted by this Parliament.
