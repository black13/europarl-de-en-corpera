Mr President, I think we should address this subject again quite calmly, Mr Bangemann.
It makes no sense at all to discuss this in a state of panic.
I would also ask my colleagues to proceed with due caution and not to react with too much excitement to comments made in the media, however important or relevant they may be.
We could certainly accept one point as a proposal, Mr Bangemann, namely that we - meaning you, of course, rather than ourselves in Parliament - should consider with the Council whether some kind of code of conduct could not be signed, not only between the individual Member States, but also between the Member States and the United States, so that when information is received through whatever channels - and this involves above all economic information, industrial espionage - it is handled with the appropriate care.
I realise that such words or statements are a little naive.
However, such codes do also have a persuasive effect when they have been signed, and this could well be a proposal for dealing with the matter sensibly.
