Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe's environment policy is characterized by two weaknesses.
Firstly, an excess of lengthy, theoretical declarations of intent and an attendant lack of practical implementing provisions.
Secondly, environment policy in Europe is known for the priority it gives to patching up the effects of damage to the environment, rather than actively preventing it from occurring.
This is a policy which, by its very nature, must always lag behind events.
Environment policy can only be successful if it moves beyond this stage.
The rapporteur has done an excellent job of recognising this and, in the amendments, at least improves upon these defects.
If structures are actually created that lay down strategic environmental assessment in advance, then a quantum leap in the whole of environment policy would have been accomplished.
