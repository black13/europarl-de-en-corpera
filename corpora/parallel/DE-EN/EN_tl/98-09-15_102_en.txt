Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Commission's proposal for the extension of environmental impact assessment to plans and programmes is a typical route one approach, from the green table in Brussels to the offside position of practical implementation in the Member States.
Mr Florenz has already given us some indications as to how the present EIA has been faring there.
The new proposal seeks to add some much more detailed elements.
It is many times more difficult than what we have had up to now, and even that was not adequately implemented.
Another attempt is being made solely to harmonise procedure and, in doing so, to interfere in the legislation and administrative authority of the Member States.
Moreover, the Commission in no way draws the obvious conclusions from the problems that have already arisen as a result of the EIA project.
I would suggest the following: before the Commission pursues this proposal any further, it should, in line with this proposal for a directive, apply the EIA to plans and programmes in its own area of responsibility, in order to gain experience with this instrument and prove that it is suitable for use.
I too am of the opinion that the legal basis is not an appropriate one.
It is the other legal basis that we need, because according to Articles 3 and 3a of the EC Treaty as amended by the Union Treaty, the EU has no legal competence for urban development, land-use plans and outline urban developments.
Since many areas of this proposal for a directive are clearly concerned with town and country planning regulations, such a proposal for a directive should, if anything, be based on Article 130s, paragraph 2.
