Mr President, I was referred to personally by Mr Florenz.
He is not here at the moment, otherwise I would have been very glad to give him a lesson on how environmental impact assessment works.
It simply is not the case that we wait for the result and then take the decision.
We all know what such an assessment is supposed to look like.
What is contained in the assessment is irrelevant afterwards.
Basically, the exercise is very successful for those who carry out the studies.
Finally, and this point has already been mentioned by Mr Lannoye, the zero options are missing.
Let us consider for a moment what would happen if the project were not implemented.
I was also referred to by Mrs Estevan Bola.
I do not think that three months are enough to bring about any serious participation by the public.
