Commissioner, I just wanted to ask exactly what this idea of the EU actually involves, and I wished to come back on two points in particular.
The first is a proposal from Bishop Belo on the demilitarisation of East Timor.
Is that being discussed?
The second relates to our programme for democracy.
Completely new parties are forming there and the danger exists that fanatical tendencies are also developing.
Is this newly emerging political spectrum also being monitored by ourselves in the context of the programme for democracy?
