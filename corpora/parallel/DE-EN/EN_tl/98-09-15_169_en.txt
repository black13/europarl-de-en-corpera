We shall be presenting this communication.
I believe it is necessary to do so, as we must now recapitulate our position.
Of course we will not stop conducting our other activities; they will be continued.
I have already said that we have taken a series of steps in the INFO 2000 programme to construct European databases and directories.
Those are, if you like, the first building blocks for a geographical information infrastructure.
We have a website at any rate, in which over 300 players are involved.
We have introduced the concept of GI 2000 time and again at conferences, and these programmes will be continued in the context of the fifth framework programme of research, as part of the new projects aimed at creating a user-friendly information society.
That therefore means that we have a whole series of activities that will, of course, be going on.
But ultimately these are all incentives.
Industry must itself take over and show greater interest than it has done hitherto.
That is why I believe that a communication of this type certainly does have a role to play.
