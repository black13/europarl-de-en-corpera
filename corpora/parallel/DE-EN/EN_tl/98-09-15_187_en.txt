Mr President, at the moment I am giving a great many lectures on the euro, and I see that it is above all the small companies which are afraid that the circulation of coins is going to increase dramatically.
It is not only that we in Austria are going up from six coins to eight, but also that in the EU at present there are only two countries which have banknotes of a higher denomination.
The other countries are used to dealing in banknotes and do not have so much hard cash in day-to-day circulation.
That is why the question arises of whether we should not consider introducing a one euro note in future.
If one looks at America for instance, there they have a one dollar note without which life could not be imagined.
This needs to be discussed.
