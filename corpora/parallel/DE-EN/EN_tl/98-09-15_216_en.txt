Madam President, the rapporteur is quite right when she refers to the difference between insurance undertakings and banks or credit institutions with regard to the risks to be taken by them.
On the other hand, everyone knows what is happening on the financial markets, and in this context we do not need to explain now how important such a directive and a commitment on this matter are, for which I naturally thank the rapporteur.
However, I want to use the rest of my speaking time, Mrs Mosiek-Urbahn, to explain the reasons why I am unfortunately unable to agree with your amendments.
It is for a quite simple reason, and that is the experience I have had with the mismanagement of holdings in the former GDR.
That is why, in this respect, I am for more rather than less monitoring.
This mismanagement of holdings has by no means come to an end and, unfortunately, it is not just happening in the former GDR.
I am afraid that what you have said in Amendment No 5 and now repeated once again shows me that there is quite a considerable need for monitoring here.
So once again, thank you very much for the work that has been done.
It is a pity that I cannot agree with your suggestions and that I am consequently proposing, on behalf of my group, the same decision as my colleague Ms Oddy.
