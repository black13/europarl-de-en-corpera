Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the name Averroës stands for the Islamic interest in the traditions of enlightenment and emancipation in Europe.
Whenever Thomas Aquinas wished to quote the most important authority for him when commenting on Aristotle, he only needed two words: commentator dicit .
His contemporaries knew that Averroës was meant by that.
I learned in school that European culture is based on antiquity, Christianity and Teutonicism.
The important report which has been presented to us, and on which I can only congratulate its author, reminds us that there is a gap in both our memory and our history.
I therefore regard it as particularly important - unlike the previous speaker - that the idea of a Euro-Islamic university is taken forward.
Admittedly, this is also a reminder that the proposed programme can only become effective when the constitutional position of Islam and its believers in the European Union has been established beyond that of a merely tolerated marginal existence, and towards a publicly recognised and guaranteed position.
