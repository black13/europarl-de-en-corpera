Mr President, introducing mandatory limit values for fuels and vehicle emissions throughout Europe will certainly make an essential contribution to keeping our air clean.
The rapporteurs are to be congratulated, above all for their persistence in gaining acceptance of their views.
Of course, the derogation clauses hurt.
In the future, we will have to press for these derogations to be as limited as possible.
Such caution is well advised, as any member of this House knows who was besieged by lobbyists in the run-up to our debates on this directive.
The agreement on the use of on-board diagnostic systems is also gratifying; it constitutes a workable compromise between consumer interests and control systems.
The right of individual Member States to grant preferential tax treatment for earlier improvements should become a major pillar of European environment policy; at some point in the future, this should be taken as a matter of course and no longer have to be negotiated separately.
