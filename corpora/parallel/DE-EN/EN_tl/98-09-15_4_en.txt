Mr President, unfortunately what Mr Sepp√§nen said is true - there was no misunderstanding.
Reference was made three times to the necessity of having an overall debate, and then we were told that it would be split into two parts, although we all knew that this would not work.
It was only at the end that we were told that questions could be asked, and then only the two big political groups were able to have their say.
This is simply unacceptable.
We strongly protest against this procedure.
The way in which Mr Bangemann dealt with this issue yesterday was inadmissible.
