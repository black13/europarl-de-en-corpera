Mr President.
I should like to make three points on Kyoto and Buenos Aires, obviously without in any way claiming to be exhaustive.
The reduction targets are already a step backwards compared with the earlier targets set in Toronto, those set by the climate alliance and the Rio targets.
So we only have a basic level of agreement.
Secondly, we should be aware that the amount of CO2 we are emitting each day is the same as that previously emitted over 3000 years put together.
I do not need 1000 American scientists to tell me that this cannot be sensible, or that it cannot be a good thing.
I do not need experts to tell me; common sense is quite enough.
If we now recognise this, then we should also recognise that the greenhouse problem is not just any old problem, but probably one of the greatest that mankind has ever had to face.
Traditional energy policy is on a crash course.
I think most of its pilots did their training on the Titanic.
The icebergs are clearly visible, and they are all saying: ' Full steam ahead'.
As regards the costs, when we debate energy policy and climate problems, we talk almost exclusively about funding.
I ask you, ladies and gentlemen, what chance a society has, which is prepared to invest in all kinds of things, but obviously is not prepared to invest in its own future and thus in the survival of its own species.
From an ethical point of view, I believe that it is only natural that this investment should begin with us.
