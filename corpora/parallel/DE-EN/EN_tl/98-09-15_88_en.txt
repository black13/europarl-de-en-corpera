Mr President, I asked a question earlier, which I consider to be very important.
Commissioner, I do not think you need to tell us what we already know.
We are familiar with your communication.
I have even read it.
The only problem is that it does not tell us anything.
The question - posed not only by myself, but also by Mr Pimenta and Mr Eisma, amongst others - was very specific: what proposal will you be making to the Environment Council?
What are the views around the table in the Environment Council about the ratio of flexible mechanisms to domestic measures?
In Kyoto you proposed a ratio of 50/50.
I would be interested to know whether this figure still stands.
Do you think the amendments along these lines are appropriate?
What will the position of the Environment Council be on this?
Are we correctly informed that 12 Environment Ministers have already jumped ship on this issue and that only three are still on board?
Please give us straight answers to these questions.
The second question, asked by Mr Lange, Mr Eisma and others, was related to the voluntary agreements.
Labelling is all well and good, but what we were all concerned about here was the question of whether it might be appropriate, in this case, also to make legislative proposals, which would force the motor vehicle industry not merely to make a one-litre reduction over 22 years, but actually to show what it has achieved when the voluntary agreements expire.
These are fundamental questions, and I would ask you to give us some clear answers!
