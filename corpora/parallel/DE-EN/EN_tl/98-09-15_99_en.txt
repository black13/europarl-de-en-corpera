Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for the Green Group, strategic assessment is a milestone on the road to greater sustainability.
The proposal for a directive aims at improving environmental protection.
It is also an instrument which would allow us to take environmental matters into consideration, comprehensively and early on, before the project stage.
For us - and here I would have to completely contradict Mrs Estevan Bolea - it is very important for many criteria to be reflected here.
One of these is doubtless the involvement of the environmental authorities and the members of the public concerned.
Making progress on projects in public is impossible without involving the public.
I would have thought that, as a Spaniard, this concept would be familiar to you, Mrs Estevan Bolea, since the disaster with the landfills in La Coru√±a could have been prevented if we had listened to the public, the environmental associations and the scientists involved.
It is regrettable that the German Government in particular, which usually leads the way, has been so negative in this process and has failed to make any constructive suggestions.
It has effectively been left on the sidelines at European level.
Another important point which Mr Lannoye has also touched upon is that unfortunately we have not succeeded in including policy sectors that receive subsidies, such as agriculture, coal and shipyards.
Here, public money is spent without ever once examining the effects of the plans involved on the environment.
We hope that strategic environmental assessment is not pushed to one side, and we would like to appeal to those Member States like Germany...
