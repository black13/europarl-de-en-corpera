Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in principle I can support the proposed amendment of the Financial Regulation.
The desire to develop European integration further and the legal bases for this - the Maastricht Treaty, the Edinburgh summit and the Amsterdam Treaty - have caused substantial changes to be made to the original Financial Regulation.
The text's coherence needs to be restored and this amendment should, therefore, be welcomed as the first stage in a general review.
Allow me, however, to use the debate on this formal amendment above all as an opportunity to emphasise the importance of the real issues underlying it.
Amending the Financial Regulation is a small but significant step on the way to the third stage of monetary union.
Firstly, and this is something we already know from the ongoing negotiations on next year's Union budget, the euro will replace the ecu as a currency unit in just a few weeks' time.
The budget also has to be prepared for this.
Secondly, the rules governing the Community budget need to be adapted to take account of the pact on stability and economic growth.
This is the backbone of the single European currency.
We all remember the efforts made by individual Member States to achieve economic convergence, which constitutes the precondition and basis for a stable euro.
The stability and growth pact should ensure that excessive deficits are not permitted in the participating Member States in the future either.
The special mechanism of sanctions will also affect the Community budget, which will be the appropriate instrument for applying it.
This system is the reason why the proposed amendment is so important.
Here, and in general, our aim must be to do all we can internally to prepare for the introduction of the euro, while at the same time ensuring maximum transparency.
