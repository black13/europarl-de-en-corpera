Mr President, I voted against the Mohamed Al√≠ report, but not because I could not wholeheartedly endorse its underlying intentions.
I merely believe that a report which is so short that it only scratches the surface of its subject simply cannot do justice to this highly complex issue with which we are confronted.
There is much in the report that I can wholeheartedly support, for example its representation of the situation of women in Islam, but there are also parts with which I cannot agree.
I just believe it does not make sense to try and cover such a sensitive, complex, broad and important subject with a report of this kind.
It is the wrong approach.
