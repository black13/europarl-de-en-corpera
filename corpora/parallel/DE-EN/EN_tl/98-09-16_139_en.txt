Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, almost three years ago this Parliament assented to the Customs Union with Turkey.
Before I deal with that, may I thank Mr McMillan-Scott for the excellent work he has done in producing his report.
I can fully endorse its contents.
Let me take you back to the time when we took that difficult decision.
We took it because we wanted to give Turkey a tangible token of our trust.
At the same time as we gave our assent, we expressed four expectations.
Some Members have already referred to these, but I should like to list them again: progress on human rights, progress in democratisation, a constructive contribution to the solution of the Cyprus problem and a peaceful resolution of the conflict with the Kurds.
I can see today that our 1995 decision was based on a twofold error of judgement.
We made the mistake of putting faith in the promises made by Mrs Ã‡iller, and the Turkish Grand National Assembly made the mistake of doubting the seriousness of our intent.
I also note that the situation in Turkey has not improved in any of those four respects and indeed has deteriorated dramatically in some areas, for example in relation to Cyprus and the Kurds.
Let me categorically express my regret that relations between the EU and Turkey have reached this new low, because I was one of those who consented to the Customs Union at that time in the hope of bringing Turkey closer to the EU and offering her a chance of future accession.
Every day the policies pursued by the Turkish Government erode our hopes and undermine our quest for rapprochement.
There is little point in our trying - perhaps slowly but none the less steadily - to draw closer to Turkey if she is going to drift faster in the opposite direction towards an uncharted and risky future.
