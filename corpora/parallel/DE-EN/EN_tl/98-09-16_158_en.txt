Madam President-in-Office, Commissioner, all we can do here is talk.
But we should not use euphemisms and must speak plainly to those responsible.
First of all, I am fed up with hearing that we should learn lessons.
The tragedy has been going on for eight years, and everyone who saw and heard about the situation in Bosnia knew that Kosovo would be the next time-bomb waiting to explode, the next disaster.
Yet nothing was done for years.
Secondly, the civilian population is quite deliberately being driven out by military terror and deliberately being decimated.
That is quite clearly a war crime.
And it needs to be said.
Next: who is responsible?
Milosevic of course!
That too has been said often enough.
But we should also say quite plainly that the national governments of our Member States meeting in the Council bear their share of responsibility after failing for years to find the appropriate political measures to tackle the situation.
These governments share the responsibility.
But two governments, those of Greece and the United Kingdom, bear special responsibility today, because they were not even prepared to endorse the Cardiff decisions on airline sanctions.
They are primarily responsible for the situation.
Let no one try to talk his way out of this: the lives of 300 000 people are at risk.
Anyone who is partly responsible but does nothing and does not apply sanctions bears a share of the blame.
That needs to be said quite clearly!
