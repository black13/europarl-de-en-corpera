Madam President-in-Office, following on from what you said about the Feldkirch meeting of the Council of Transport Ministers, the problem, after all, is that because the negotiations with Switzerland were not completed, Austria and France are suffering severely from the diversion in transit traffic.
Since we keep being told the negotiations are nearing their end, although in fact no headway is being made, the following problem also arises: could the European Union not allow France, Switzerland and Austria to harmonise their road-use charges so as to put a stop, for the time being at least, to the transit traffic diversion?
I am putting this supplementary question because of what the French Transport Minister said at the Feldkirch meeting, where he openly supported an ecological transport policy for the Alps, which after all are not just Austrian, but indeed European.
