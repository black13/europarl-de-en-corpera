Mr President, Mrs Eriksson, I can only add a few theoretical comments on what the doctrine is in principle, but it has in fact never been applied and no provision is made for it in the Treaty.
Neither the EU Treaty nor the three Treaties establishing the Communities provide for the right for an individual state to withdraw.
It follows that, in principle, it is out of the question for a Member State to withdraw or resign.
The Member States are the masters of the Treaties and their commitment to these Treaties is founded on their resolve to accept long-term membership; of course in the final analysis - according to doctrine at least - they can suspend this by an act to the contrary, an actus contrarius .
But the withdrawal of one Member State would require the agreement of all the others and would probably require amending the Treaty and observance of all the general requirements set out in the Vienna Convention on treaty law.
