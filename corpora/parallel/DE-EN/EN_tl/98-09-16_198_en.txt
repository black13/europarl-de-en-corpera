Mr President, Mr Krarup, I did not say that.
I said that I am speaking on behalf of the Council and that pursuant to Article 240 of the EC Treaty, this Treaty is concluded for an unlimited period and that there is no provision made for unilateral withdrawal.
But I also said that the question has been discussed in theoretical terms, and that is all I have to say on the matter.
I believe if you want to go into this question in more detail, you will have to consult an expert in international law, not the Council whom I represent here.
