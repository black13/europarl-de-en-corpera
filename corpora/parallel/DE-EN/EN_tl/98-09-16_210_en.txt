Mr President, Mr Smith, I would ask you to put this question about the Dounreay nuclear installation to the Commission, because it is up to the Commission to ensure observance of the Treaty and specifically of the provisions laid down by the Treaty.
So it has all the necessary information to give you a reliable answer.
But in general terms, let me tell you once again that of course the Council will always check to ensure very stringent compliance with the Community standards and international principles that are in force in the nuclear sector, especially with regard to accession negotiations.
