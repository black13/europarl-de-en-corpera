Mr President, Mr Falconer, the further Israeli troop withdrawal from the West Bank provided for in the Interim Agreement between Israel and the Palestinians is long overdue.
For several months now, the USA has been trying to mediate with a view to persuading the Israelis to withdraw from a further 13 % of the West Bank.
An agreement to that effect would enable the parties to resume the negotiations on the final status of the Palestinian autonomous area, which are due to be completed by 4 March 1999 according to the original timetable.
Although the US proposals do not match up to the Palestinian wishes, Mr Arafat accepted them.
The Israelis reject them on the grounds of security interests, but have proposed a 10 + 3 % formula, which provides that 3 % of the land around Israeli settlements would be a nature conservation area over which Israel would retain final responsibility for security.
Of course I know that the Security Council resolutions to which you referred are most important here.
And we are endeavouring to make the European Union's role in the peace process more visible too, because the foundation stones for resolving the conflict remain - and I agree with you here - the principles of Madrid and Oslo, in particular 'land for peace', full implementation of the existing contractual provisions of the Israeli-Palestinian Interim Agreement and the relevant UN Security Council decisions.
We strongly support continued EU economic assistance to the Palestinian people.
Palestinian economic growth is a prerequisite for political stability.
Your other point, namely the question of trade agreements, does in fact primarily concern the Commission.
So I would ask you to put that question to the Commission.
