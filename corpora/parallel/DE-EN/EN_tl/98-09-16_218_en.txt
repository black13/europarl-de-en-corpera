Mr President, Mr Bonde, I have just given you detailed figures that show that confidentiality is in fact being applied less and less.
At the forthcoming extraordinary meeting of Heads of State and Government in PÃ¶rtschach in Austria, we will raise the questions of bringing Europe closer to the people, transparency, subsidiarity, and so forth.
This will certainly offer another opportunity to call for even greater transparency.
But by and large, I believe that these Council figures - and I am only speaking for the Council here - show that we are taking a quite different approach now from in the past.
Let me add that on 19 March 1998 it was decided to make a data register available to the public as soon as possible to supplement the existing system of electronic data transmission.
This multilingual data register will be available on the Internet so that every citizen can access Council documents by title, date and number.
