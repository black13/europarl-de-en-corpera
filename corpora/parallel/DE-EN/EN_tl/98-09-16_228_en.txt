Mr President, Mr RÃ¼big, this is a question the Council has not considered so far.
I believe we ought to discuss it in the appropriate working parties.
I am quite happy to do so.
But we do not have a proposal from the Commission, which is usually the first step.
And we must have a Commission proposal before we can discuss any options at all.
