Madam President, Slovenia is operating a nuclear power station near the Austrian border.
We have been informed that irradiated waste is being stored in a surface storage facility, but that final storage has not yet been decided.
We find this unacceptable and unsafe.
If accession talks are held with Slovenia, will the question of nuclear safety and final storage also be raised in those negotiations?
