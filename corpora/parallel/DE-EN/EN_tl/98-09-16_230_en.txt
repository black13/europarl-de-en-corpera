Mr President, Mr Pirker, in general let me say that this and similar questions are of course raised during accession negotiations, in particular the question of nuclear safety.
The Council will always ensure during accession negotiations that the Community norms in force, and in particular all the international principles in the nuclear sector, are stringently observed.
For the rest, the Austrian Presidency holds regular bilateral talks with Slovenia.
That is a subject I do not want to go into here, but the talks do also cover these specific matters.
