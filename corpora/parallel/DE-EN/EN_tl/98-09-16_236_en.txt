Mr President, Mr Apolin√°rio, in pursuance of the objectives set out in its common position of 25 June 1996, the European Union continues to support the initiatives undertaken in the UN framework; these may contribute to resolving the question of East Timor through a fair, comprehensive and internationally acceptable solution which fully respects the rights of the East Timorese people, in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the UN General Assembly and in conformity with the principles enshrined in the UN Charter.
The European Union sent a troika mission to East Timor, which was there from 26 to 30 June.
Following a Council decision, the troika mission report was published on 24 July.
The main outcome of this mission is as follows.
Firstly, according to its members, any long-term solution to the East Timor issue must respect the wishes of the East Timorese people.
Secondly, a dialogue should be opened without delay, which should include the representatives of the East Timorese people.
Thirdly, all partners must show flexibility in the negotiations.
Fourthly, visible confidence-building measures should be implemented immediately.
Let me also emphasise that the all-inclusive intra-Timorese dialogue has now been held three times, with Austria acting as host on all three occasions.
The next round of talks is scheduled for October, again in Austria.
On 3 and 4 August, tripartite talks were held in New York between the UN Secretary-General and the foreign ministers of Indonesia and Portugal.
The European Union noted the results with satisfaction.
These include closer involvement of the East Timorese people in the search for a solution.
The members of the troika mission also supported this.
I believe it is enormously important that we make further progress in confidence building among the various East Timorese groups, and I believe that in future we must play an even greater role in seeking a satisfactory solution acceptable to all parties.
