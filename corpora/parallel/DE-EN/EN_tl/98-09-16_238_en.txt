Mr President, Mr Apolinário, thank you for your words of encouragement.
Let me add a few comments.
On 22 July, shortly before the summer recess, I myself spoke with Ramos Horta in Lisbon; he told me he was prepared to support the proposed autonomy provided this was only an interim solution, and that a referendum would be held on East Timor's final status in a few years' time.
Let me also say a few words about the matter of the prisoners that has been raised.
We too are monitoring the health of the prisoners being held in Dili jail with great concern.
Last week this matter was discussed in the Asia-Oceania working party.
The presidency's representative in Djakarta is in constant contact with the Red Cross, which keeps him up to date on the health of all the prisoners on hunger strike.
He has also urged the Indonesian authorities to provide the necessary medicines and medical care.
According to the Austrian embassy in Djakarta, which represents the presidency, a doctor visits the hunger strikers regularly and has confirmed that the health situation is under control.
On Xanana Gusmão, let me point out that of course the question of the prisoners and the release of Xanana Gusmão was also raised during the talks with Ramos Horta, but clearly there will have to be further talks under the aegis of the United Nations in New York.
As you know, a few of the East Timorese who took refuge in the Austrian embassy in Djakarta are still there.
Here too, we are seeking a solution acceptable both to the East Timorese and to the two conflicting parties.
