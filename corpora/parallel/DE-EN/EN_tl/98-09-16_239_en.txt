Madam President-in-Office, I have two quite specific questions.
The first concerns the proposal to demilitarise East Timor that keeps coming up in the discussions.
The second concerns the emergence of new parties in Indonesia, where a new phenomenon is arising, namely that some of them are Islamist.
We know that East Timor has a largely Christian population.
There are fears that this could create tensions, and I wish to ask whether it might not be possible to involve the newly emerging parties in Indonesia in the democracy programmes on a partnership basis.
