Mr President, Mr Andersson, all I can say is this.
There are two articles that provide for exemptions regarding the size of the target area.
Article 9 provides that, in exceptional cases, urban areas in fairly small cities - i.e. cities with fewer than 100 000 inhabitants - can also be included.
Article 10 of that European Commission communication defines this rule more precisely and provides that, in duly justified cases, support can also be given for actions in small and mediumsized cities suffering from general economic decline.
So this means that smaller cities can also be supported under the URBAN programme.
