Mr President, the question which is before us for discussion here is certainly a difficult one, and one and a half minutes is really only long enough to examine one aspect of it.
I think that the point about reducing VAT on labourintensive jobs is the most far-reaching.
Here, of course, the extremely difficult question of delimitation arises.
If we include broad areas, it undoubtedly leads to endless debate.
We would have to establish very clear social and ecological criteria, including first and foremost the employment requirement, and we would have to define a limited list on which to negotiate.
Basic principles, then, will enable us to make headway along the right lines.
There is a willingness to tackle this issue, and individual Member States have generally had very positive experiences here.
If the Commission were able to make progress along these lines, then we could actually achieve political success in this otherwise very technical sector.
