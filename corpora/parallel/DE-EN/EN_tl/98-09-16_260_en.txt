Mr President, I should like to start by apologising, as I have just opened up the wrong file in my head.
I have a belated comment to make on the Secchi report.
This is rather unusual, I know, but it is a practical point.
We tabled our amendments because we do not want the necessary changes that Mr Secchi has suggested to lead to new opportunities for tax evasion and tax avoidance being created.
We would like the Member States themselves and Community legislation to take steps to ensure this does not happen.
Moving on to the issue of the VAT system, I have already made some comments on this.
What has basically happened - and here for once I really am of the same opinion as Mr Langen - is that the single currency has made the Member States prisoners of their own selfishness.
If there is a way to break out of the prison then it is through binding Community regulations.
For that reason the Green Party also welcomes the regulatory powers that are being envisaged for the VAT Committee.
Like Mr Langen, we also believe that the report to the European Parliament, which will provide transparency and also facilitate dialogue, constitutes a type of precondition.
We agree, too, that the provisions must be transposed by 1 January 1999 if the system as a whole is to be efficient.
We also regard Mr Miller's comments as useful.
We need to look at comitology once again, going back to its origins in the Plumb/Delors Agreement, and we need to be sure that we are indeed creating a logical and coherent system, one that guarantees transparency and efficiency.
That, however, is another matter.
