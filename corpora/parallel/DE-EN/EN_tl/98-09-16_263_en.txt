Mr President, it is doubtless a wonderful advertisement for the closer integration of Parliament into the law-making process when we do not only discuss abstract political subjects here in the plenary, but also talk about actual examples of implementation.
This morning, for example, we talked generally about comitology and debated the need for this House to be included in the process of formulating objectives, and now with the Miller report from the Committee on Excise Duties, we have the possibility of putting this into practice.
This Committee is a very important instrument.
It has more than an advisory role, it also ensures the uniform interpretation and application of provisions on excise duty.
Our concern is with preserving transparency and the rules of democracy, particularly because Parliament deals with common legislation.
We need to know about developments in the various committees and we have to implement parliamentary guidelines.
This also applies to the Committee on Excise Duties.
In this respect, then, I find the proposal from DirectorateGeneral XXI that the Committee should not apply certain procedures in Directive 97/12 and particularly Article 7 interesting.
That would automatically mean amending the law without involving Parliament.
That is why I would ask the Commissioner how this proposal ties in with the general wish for Parliament to have more say and with the policy being pursued by the Commission in its reform of comitology?
