Mr President, I would like to focus on one particular aspect which appears to me to be important and which is dealt with for the first time in the report by Mr Scarbonchi, namely the need to concentrate aid on SMEs in tourism.
The lack of a European policy on tourism means that large sums from EU aid coffers are not being deployed in the right way, with huge concentrations of rather dubious tourist accommodation as the result.
Over-capacities are being created that are distorting competition.
But SMEs, which are the typical European tourist business both in terms of quality and quantity, are being left out in the cold.
In future, European aid policy in tourism must set clear priorities geared towards improving the quality, competitiveness and marketing capacity of SMEs.
It is especially the SMEs in tourism that have shown they are in a position to safeguard jobs and to create extra employment.
An extremely significant question about the future is handled in paragraphs 6 and 7.
Programmes to link up agriculture, tourism and commerce are needed to stop people and companies from leaving rural areas with difficult conditions, such as Alpine areas.
They must prevent whole valleys and regions from becoming deserted and turning into disaster areas.
