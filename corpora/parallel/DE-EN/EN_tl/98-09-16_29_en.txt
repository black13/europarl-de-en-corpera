Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I share the view of the President of the Commission that any assessment of the situation in Russia will certainly also have to take account of the fact that the European Union has perhaps failed on occasion to manage the provision of assistance as efficiently as it might have done, but there again we are only human and are not infallible.
On the other hand, from my experience as a member of the joint delegation of the European Parliament and the Russian State Duma and Federal Council, I can tell you that on many questions of Russian reform policy, we have effectively been conducting the same talks with our Russian colleagues since 1994.
These talks relate to the very areas in which there has been an absence of reforms which would make Russia an attractive business location and investment target.
The first of these areas is the tax system, then come the facts that there is no code of real-estate law and that the system of banks and finance markets does not work, not to mention numerous other important shortcomings.
I have the impression that this discussion has been going on for years and has not really produced any results.
For a long time now in Russia, the executive and legislature have been blocking each other, and I can only wish and hope that the new Russian Government does not have to work in a political vacuum, but that there is a realistic prospect of it obtaining parliamentary support for its work.
It is and will remain one of our main tasks, especially for the Delegation of the European Parliament for relations with the Russian Federation, to be absolutely specific in our talks with colleagues from the State Duma as to where reforms are needed and to voice any criticisms of developments and political processes in Russia, not in a carping way but constructively, with a view to exerting influence that will promote the continuation and success of reform policies.
I believe that this will be the key task confronting the members of our Parliament over the next few days when we sit down with the Russian delegation.
