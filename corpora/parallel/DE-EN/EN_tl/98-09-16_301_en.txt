Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Third Multiannual Programme of the European Union is a cornerstone of our policy for SMEs and that is why Mr RÃ¼big's report is terribly important.
The fact that now, in the context of EU enlargement, we are opening up this programme to include Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Poland, Romania and the Slovak Republic, is more than welcome.
It would also have been nice if Slovenia, Latvia and Lithuania could have been alongside them.
I cannot accept that these countries are being singled out for non-participation for formal reasons.
I hope that this will change in future.
Looking at this massive project, it appears to me important that we see this Community programme as a part of the preaccession strategy, and for that reason we should be looking at the economic structures in these countries at the same time.
But no amount of money is going to produce what we need for SMEs at this point, which is vision.
This SME policy can guide companies towards it, but it can also, and this is especially important to me, strengthen the spirit of SMEs.
It is all about having a certain attitude to certain things at this point.
We need own-initiative, entrepreneurial commitment - i.e. alongside money, we need advice, training and incentives.
Therefore I believe it is important to try to do something about bureaucracy in these countries, to promote legal certainty and to provide support.
We must, in other words, improve the overall package with accompanying measures.
The problem here has something to do with the fact that in these countries too, less government is what is needed and not more.
With our programme we should be contributing to increasing own-initiative.
