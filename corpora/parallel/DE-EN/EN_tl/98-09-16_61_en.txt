Mr President, I am not entirely clear about the substance of the matter on which we are voting.
May I ask someone from the Party of European Socialists to explain it?
Amendment No 4 calls on the Commission to submit proposals extending the right of family reunification to children and relatives in ascending line who are not entitled to maintenance.
Is that intended for citizens of the Union, or is it supposed to apply to nationals of third countries?
That would trigger a wave of immigration, which is why I am asking for an explanation as to what is meant here.
Does it only apply to citizens of the Union, or are third country nationals included?
The answer will naturally have a decisive influence on the vote.
