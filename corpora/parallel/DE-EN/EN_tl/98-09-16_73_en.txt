Mr President, I thank the rapporteur, the content of whose report is consistent with the position of our group.
The amendments address the substantive points on which we sought clarification in the framework of the Interinstitutional Agreement.
Since Mr Liikanen signalled clearly in yesterday's debate that every effort will be made to create these legal bases together with Parliament in future, as well as to guarantee maximum implementation of the budget in 1998, I am prepared to withdraw the amendment on behalf of my group.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
