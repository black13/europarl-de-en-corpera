Mr President, I should like to ask you not to take a block vote but to take separate votes, certainly on Amendments Nos 4, 12 and 13.
Moreover, there was an unfortunate mistake in the vote on the Schaffner report.
The motion requested a vote by roll call at the end of the debate, and I should like you to tell us why you did not allow a roll-call vote.
