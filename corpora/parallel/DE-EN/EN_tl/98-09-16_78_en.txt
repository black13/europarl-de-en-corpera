Mr President, may I come back to your statement in reply to my previous question.
You said it was an oversight by the services in not passing on the motion for a roll-call vote on Mrs Schaffner's report.
That is just one of those things that can happen to anyone.
But you, as the President of the sitting, are able to have the vote taken again as a roll-call vote.
That is what I am now asking you to do.
The fact that a mistake was made is no reason for not repeating the vote.
I therefore request a roll-call vote on the Schaffner report.
