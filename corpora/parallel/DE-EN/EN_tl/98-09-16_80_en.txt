Mr President, I refer again to Mrs Schaffner's report.
You have said that it is not possible to vote again now because the composition of the House may have changed.
But it is possible for you to defer this vote until voting time tomorrow, and that the groups themselves, knowing that the vote is taking place, can ensure that they are duly represented.
Then we can vote by roll call.
It does make a difference whether we vote by roll call or in secret; it even sways Members' voting decisions.
That, in fact, is why this request is being made.
