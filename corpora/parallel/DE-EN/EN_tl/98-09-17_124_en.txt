Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I would like to point out that I was present at the elections in Albania as an election observer.
On the day before the vote, President Berisha received both myself and a fellow Member of this House as guests and pleaded with us to urge the socialists to recognise the election result.
The election result, which many representatives of this House considered to be absolutely just and fair, despite all the problems which arose, gave the socialists an absolute majority.
However, the situation which then arose was one in which President Berisha and his Democratic Party did not recognise the elections in Albania.
This is one of the main causes.
Mr Karl Habsburg yesterday accused me of disregarding the law.
I reject this accusation.
I am not excusing anyone for the current situation in Albania.
The assassination, like any assassination, is to be condemned completely.
Parliament did so at the time, and we have also condemned it.
Yet the fact is that today the former president and some of his party do not wish to recognise the results of the last election.
Therefore, I fully agree with Mr Frischenschlager that the European Union must not recognise any border changes brought about by violence, and not in Kosovo either, given all the problems that I dealt with yesterday.
To begin to do so would be to trigger a conflagration in the Balkans on a scale bigger than any we have seen in recent years.
Similarly, however, this House must recognise election results which have been achieved democratically.
I would therefore ask our conservative colleagues to suggest to President Berisha and his supporters that they put an end to violence, recognise the election results and work in the Albanian parliament in a peaceful and cooperative way towards a better future for their country!
