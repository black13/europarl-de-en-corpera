Mr President, I must say quite honestly that the resolution that we hope to adopt today, and that we drafted in a joint initiative, makes me sad as my group has tried constantly in the course of the last few months to implement a resolution on Albania and on the crisis in Albania, but unfortunately this failed in Parliament because of certain other groups.
It is alarming that it required the assassination of Mr Azem Hajdari, a charismatic opposition leader, before a resolution on the actual crisis situation was drafted, particularly if we consider that this was the third attempt on Mr Hajdari's life.
One assassination attempt took place in the Albanian parliament and another in his own home, where an attempted shooting took place.
Many people try to place the full blame on the opposition alone.
The fact that the resolution was tabled here only after the assassination of an opposition leader shows that this is not quite true.
I would also like to discuss the fact that we only ever mention the Democratic Party in Albania.
It is not the only opposition party.
There are seven opposition parties in total, who usually speak with one voice and who have confirmed unanimously that the situation is not as clean and as legal as the government would often have us believe.
Of course, Mr Swoboda, we in the House recognised the elections by a majority vote, despite the difficulties which you mentioned.
However, we must also acknowledge that these opposition parties are all of the view that, where the law is concerned, there is a considerable state of confusion, not only in the opposition but also in the government, and that the most unfortunate methods are being used by all concerned, which undoubtedly aggravates the situation.
We must clearly do everything we can, particularly considering Albania's circumstances, to bring about stability.
