Mr President, when I hear certain people going on about democracy, I would like to remind them that Fatos Nano himself came from a totalitarian party, that he was a long-time dictator and that he was removed from power and convicted of criminal activities.
I mention this because this no one else has!
Similarly, much too little has been made of the fact that events are happening very quickly due to the assassination of one of the opposition leaders, following two attempts on his life.
It is simply wrong and hypocritical to place all the blame on one side, as certain people are trying to do here.
We must work towards finally restoring law and order in Albania.
The government has broken the law just as much as the opposition.
It is obvious that this will, of course, be a very difficult task, as Albania is currently in a very dangerous situation.
We must be very clear that there is a danger that the situation will assume epidemic proportions, but this is likely to begin in Kosovo rather than in Albania.
We have not yet done anything decisive about Kosovo.
We only threaten again and again to take action, one example being the various air manoeuvres which in any case came to nothing.
Our credibility has suffered greatly, and we should at long last present a more resolute front to the dictator, Milosevic, and commit ourselves more strongly to finding a solution in Kosovo.
We hope that the situation in Albania will then soon ease.
