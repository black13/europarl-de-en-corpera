Mr President, I would merely like, on behalf of my group, to draw attention to the fact that in paragraph 2 they have criticised the Commission on one point, which is something that we have never done before in this House.
Until now, we have always supported the Council and the Commission, of course, when they have made a statement against extra-territorial actions.
You will surely remember the lively Helms-Burton and d'Amato debates which we had here in the House.
We have held many debates, and the Commission and the Council have always had our full support.
I would like to ask you to change 'criticises' in paragraph 2 to 'notes' .
This is a neutral observation.
It would be in line with our overall policy.
If you cannot approve this, we will be in danger of no longer being able to explain our policy in future to the United States, which has always taken the same line on this (it is also the only one the State of Massachusetts follows).
It will make our policy illogical, which will lead to a situation where the Americans laugh at us and we make ourselves look ridiculous.
I would ask you to amend this point.
I would be very pleased if the Greens and also the conservatives in this House could support this.
I believe that this was probably simply a small mistake.
I do not believe that the House has suddenly changed its political beliefs from those it had in all the other resolutions and decisions that we have drafted thus far.
