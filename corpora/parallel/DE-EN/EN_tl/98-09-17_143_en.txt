Mr President, here we are talking about Afghanistan again, and there is no end in sight!
If the Taliban in Afghanistan did not already have a reputation for disregarding all rights, we would have to remind one another of it daily.
Who, apart from those in power - that is, those in possession of weapons - still has rights in this country once known as the land of the free?
Contempt for human beings, in particular contempt for the rights of women and for political rights, is bad enough, but terrorism and massacres for ethnic reasons and murder are even worse.
However, refusing one's own people humanitarian aid is among the worst.
Drugs cultivation has also been mentioned.
We fully support this resolution's request to the European Union, the UN and the UNDP to revise their programmes and introduce new measures to ensure that the money which we really urgently need in other areas does not fall into the wrong hands.
