Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the violence of the Taliban regime, the widespread suppression, the violation of fundamental human rights, the international impact and the danger of an escalation of the conflict beyond Afghanistan, are all increasing daily.
The European Parliament must, therefore, call upon the international community finally to take coherent action.
Priority must be given to affording the international aid organisations the necessary diplomatic protection to allow them to continue their work to help the impoverished Afghan population.
This requires decisive and coherent action from the international community.
It means that an attempt must be made to put an end to any form of support for the Taliban regime.
The EU must bring pressure to bear on those states which, on the grounds of cynical political calculation, will still not stop at using the Taliban to further their own interests.
