Mr President, we have here three resolutions on the death penalty in the Philippines, in Gaza and in El Salvador.
Three death penalties in three different continents.
The death penalty cannot be changed once it has been carried out, but the reasons for which it is imposed are varied and some of these certainly can be changed.
From the point of view of human rights, therefore, the death penalty should not exist
We in the House have opposed the death penalty for a long time, and for this reason we call upon all three countries not only to refrain from executing the death sentences imposed, but also to amend their laws so as to abolish the death penalty or prevent its introduction.
The death penalty has not been applied in the Philippines since 1976.
In Gaza, human rights organisations have criticised both the procedure and its enforcement.
In El Salvador, circumstances are somewhat different.
It is planned to introduce it there, but a three-quarters majority is required to do so, which is why it is not even being put to the vote.
So we should not really even be voting on this issue, but if a vote is taken we would like to ask the other groups to adopt our amendment, in the interests of cooperation and equal treatment.
However, our main demand is still that the death penalty should be abolished or not introduced.
