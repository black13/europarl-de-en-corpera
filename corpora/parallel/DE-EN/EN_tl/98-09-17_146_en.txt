Mr President, human dignity is inviolable, and the motives for the death penalty are contrary to human dignity.
I believe that the House is in agreement on this.
The right to life, contempt for state murder under the pretext of punishment, the risk of miscarriage of justice, the disproportionate number of victims among the poor, and violations of human rights by the criminal prosecution authorities are, at least in the Philippines, where 600 are currently under sentence of death, arguments for upholding the moratorium and appealing to the newly elected president to exercise his authority and adhere to the aim of abolishing the death penalty.
Leo Echegaray's repulsive crime must not be used as a pretext for getting round this policy.
I think that we should be in agreement on taking joint action on this.
