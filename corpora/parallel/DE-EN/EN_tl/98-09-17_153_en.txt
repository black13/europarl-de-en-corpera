Mr President, as I am sure you know, I was present in Cambodia as an election observer on behalf of this Parliament.
I must say that the elections were, on the whole, fair and just, and 96 % of the European observers and 93 % of other international observers agreed on this.
What is very unfortunate, as in the case of Albania, is that those who lost are not prepared to recognise the result of this election.
However, there has been a welcome turn of events, in that the second largest party, the royalist FUNCINPEC, has given up its parliamentary boycott and will take part in parliamentary work.
This does not yet mean that they are prepared to take joint parliamentary responsibility, but a considerable force in the country has nevertheless given up its boycott, which may contribute greatly to bringing peace to this country.
This is what the country needs most urgently and what we must support.
I regret that I cannot comment more specifically on this.
We can endorse the resolution, but I would ask for an addition to take account of this latest development, which is, after all, a positive one.
