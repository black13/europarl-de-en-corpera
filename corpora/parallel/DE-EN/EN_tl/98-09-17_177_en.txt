Mr President, if it were not so sad, it would be laughable.
Every year, in September or October, we have massive forest fires in southern Europe, and we have had a great many fires, more than 5000 this summer in Greece, sometimes more than 200 a day.
And this year, of course, we want to debate the issue again.
As is clear from the resolutions, this is partly due to the fact that we do not really discuss the underlying causes.
These are, firstly, controversial development and, secondly, unsustainable forestry.
We need to do more than discuss a few methods of prevention, airborne firefighting teams, insurance issues and claim settlements.
First of all, we need adequate legislation, full implementation, qualified personnel and effective administration, and rather than lifting controls on development, we need to introduce compulsory reforestation.
Secondly, we need a form of forest management which makes proper use of biodiversity, spatial organisation and the separation of cultivated areas and natural vegetation in order to create forests in the Mediterranean region as they were in 500 BC.
I would now like only to mention one crucial point, which is the danger represented by eucalyptus.
This burns extremely quickly and, in addition, destroys water reserves.
