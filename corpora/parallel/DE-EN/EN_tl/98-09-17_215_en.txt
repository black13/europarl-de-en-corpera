The question is whether firms should be forced by a specific individual right to take the relevant organisational measures.
That is something quite different from what Mrs Lulling has proposed.
Mrs Lulling is only calling for provision of legislation on the issue.
But here it is a question of a clear individual right.
That is something different.
We really must not confuse the two.
