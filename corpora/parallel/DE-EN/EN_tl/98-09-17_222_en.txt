Madam President, it is an incredible disgrace for this House that, due to the intransigence of some parliamentary groups, we were not in a position to adopt a text on Kosovo, and this in the dramatic situation of unutterable misery which currently exists there.
In my opinion, we must in the near future concentrate vigorously on two points.
The first is to demilitarise Kosovo and to replace the mercenaries and groups of soldiers marauding there with an international peacekeeping force, and the second is to put police, administration and jurisdiction back into the hands of the elected authorities in Kosovo.
We should be able to reach agreement on this minimal programme.
We should concentrate on this, and then we can avoid disgraces such as we have seen today.
