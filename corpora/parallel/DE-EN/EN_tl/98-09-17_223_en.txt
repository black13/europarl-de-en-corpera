Madam President, I agree with Mr Posselt that it is a disgrace that we cannot reach agreement.
However, I would like to request that Mr Posselt and his friends look for the common ground in this difficult issue.
If you think that a majority can only be achieved by taking a tough line, you have seen today that this is not possible.
Please seek the common ground with the social democrats in the House on this important issue, and then we will be able to reach agreement.
