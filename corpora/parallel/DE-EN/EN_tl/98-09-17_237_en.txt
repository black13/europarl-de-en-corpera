I hold Mrs Marinucci in very high regard, but I have had to reject this motion because it was ideological, it infringed completely the principle of subsidiarity and more or less stated that all young women in the European Union should pursue a career after their education.
This is completely absurd!
Mrs Seillier proposed that we should leave it up to the women themselves to decide whether they devote themselves to their family and the home or to professional life.
This was rejected.
This is an ideological delusion and I really must say that we in the European Parliament are making complete fools of ourselves with reports of this kind.
In my opinion, we should approach such important issues as women and the family with much greater care.
