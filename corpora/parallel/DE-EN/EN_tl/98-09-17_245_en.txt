Thank you.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, demographic surveys show that the population is ageing and that, as a result, the need for certain social services is increasing.
This applies in particular to women who have not had a good education and who are probably those most affected by conditions on the labour market.
However, there are often very high non-wage labour costs involved in employing these women in the service sector, thus the danger arises that these women may drift into the black economy.
For this reason, any models which differ from this, such as cooperatives, associations and relief organizations, should be used to counteract these problems.
In its 1993 White Paper on Growth, Competitiveness and Employment, the European Union defined a job creation strategy and recommended an active labour market policy.
A new White Paper is a welcome development.
The European Commission considers domestic services to be an area in which a high number of jobs could be created.
One possibility would be service contracts which facilitate work in private households, where the employee would automatically have social insurance as a result of the contract, even where a low number of hours are worked.
This model offers an opportunity to many women, particularly in social economy services.
The disadvantage in this is certainly that wages are low.
However, it should not be overlooked that these social services constitute a good start for unemployed women who are less qualified.
I hope, therefore, that the models described represent a significant step towards fairer integration of women into the labour market.
