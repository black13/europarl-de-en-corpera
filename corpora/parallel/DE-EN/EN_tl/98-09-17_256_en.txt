Mr President, Mrs García Arias, I am very pleased to approve your report, but in discussions on family policy we almost always make the mistake of discussing the rights of mothers and even the rights of fathers, but not the rights of children.
I believe that children brought up by single mothers have exactly the same right as children who have two parents - and they must have this right - to be brought up, looked after and cared for by their mother.
What I find lacking in this report, therefore, is any reference to the fact that single mothers must have the right to stay at home with their small children if they wish to do so.
They should have just the same rights as mothers who are in a happy marriage and have no financial worries.
I am very proud of the fact that Austria offers single mothers a real choice.
Married mothers in Austria receive a maternity allowance for 18 months of ATS 5 700, the equivalent of over BEF 17 000.
Single mothers receive approximately BEF 24 600 per month.
I would recommend that all Member States do the same.
However, the current report also shows, Mrs García Arias, that single mothers are often unemployed, poorly educated or perhaps are not even entitled to maternity allowance because they may not have worked.
I would like to point to the example of the current Presidency on family policy.
We in Austria are currently trying to introduce maternity allowance entitlement for all mothers, including students, farming women, entrepreneurs and women who are too poorly educated or too young to have worked.
These women should also receive the necessary financial support, should also have the right to stay at home with their young children, as do prosperous women who are happily married.
I call upon all Member States to stop talking big and, instead, to follow suit.
