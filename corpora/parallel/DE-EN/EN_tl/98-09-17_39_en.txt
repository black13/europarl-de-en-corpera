Mr President, I should like to start by making a fairly basic comment.
In this debate, the term women's lobby was mentioned, or lobby for women's issues.
This gives the impression that what we are discussing here is the concern of one section of society, which I very much doubt.
We will have immense problems in our society if we do not resolve the difficult issue of the unequal treatment of men and women on the labour market, which is only going to get worse as problems on the work front become more pressing.
It is therefore a problem for society as a whole.
One point in the report particularly interested and even alarmed me.
Although women have more than caught up with men when it comes to education, and even partly overtaken them, their problems in the world of work remain.
Women with a higher qualifications are especially affected.
The main problem for women lies in working and having children.
This must be our central starting point in future - we have to set up approved, all-day child care in our countries.
It is not only women, but also fathers raising children alone who face the problem that work and bringing up children are incompatible, which can only be resolved if there are competent institutions for looking after and educating children.
Society, the public authorities and private initiatives should tackle this.
That is the central point.
