Mr President, this report from Mrs Marinucci touches on the sore points that women still have.
Firstly, they still do not receive the same pay for the same work.
Secondly, women are still more affected by unemployment than men.
This does not only have something to do with education, but most importantly with the fact that women who have children are disadvantaged on the labour market.
That is bad for women and bad for children, who very often also suffer as a result of the misconception that people have of equal opportunities for women.
So what needs to happen?
An environment has to be created as quickly as possible which makes it easier to reconcile work and family.
That means greater flexibility in organising working time, and also of course better childcare facilities.
But these should not become children's homes, which simply lead to children being isolated.
We need both: childcare facilities and greater freedom of choice.
Our Ministry for Families has come up with one idea here, for example, that parental paid leave should be introduced for all mothers and fathers, regardless of whether or not they have worked or still are working, in order to make the choice easier for both men and women.
I believe that this idea should be considered at a European level too.
There has to be more choice, not just an alternative between work or child.
