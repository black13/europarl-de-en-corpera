Mr President, we do not need to waste time on unimportant issues.
In the context of the Socialists' amendment we discussed whether there should be a reduction.
Our Amendment No 18 specifies the form which this reduction should take.
If we had followed the correct voting procedure, our amendment would have come first, and then we would have had the correct sequence.
I insist that our Amendment No 18 be put to the vote, and anyone who can read will see that it is different.
