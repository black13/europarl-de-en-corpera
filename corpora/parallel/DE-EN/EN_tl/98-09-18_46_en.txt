Thank you, Mr President.
Mr Schwaiger, I should like to congratulate you on the excellent sauce and accompaniments you have served up, and the care you have taken with your preparations.
Unfortunately, carrying on this morning's theme, the fish itself is not very fresh and leaves a rather bitter taste in the mouth.
The interim agreement is designed to implement the trade elements of the partnership and cooperation agreement first.
Given the history of the last 500 years it is simply hypocritical to claim that free trade somehow automatically generates democracy and human rights, or else it shows a cynical disregard for the problems of the people involved - not on your part, I hasten to add, but by those who have negotiated the agreement and who use the safety clause so one-sidedly.
There are sure to be misgivings about this in the Member States too, which this interim agreement is designed to circumvent.
The human rights situation is disastrous.
Despite the OECD's insistence that a peace agreement had to be reached the war with Armenia is still continuing.
I do not wish to go into detail here and would simply mention a few salient facts.
On 12 September the police assaulted 34 journalists on the fringes of a demonstration organised by the opposition and confiscated their equipment.
On 1 September the journalist Tai Hamid was dragged from his car and assaulted.
In such a situation we should use the existing CIS agreements to provide aid and to develop relations, instead of allowing trade to monopolise our attention.
We therefore intend to abstain in the vote on your report.
