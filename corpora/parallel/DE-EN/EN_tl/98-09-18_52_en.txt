Mr President, after the votes we are always shown how Members have voted.
It is extremely important for us to be able to tell journalists and members of the public what the majority was.
However, the results of the votes are usually shown so quickly that there is no time to write them down.
I would therefore ask you to show the results for longer so that people have time to write them down.
