Mr President, the Group of the Party of European Socialists recommends adopting the report and waiving Mr Le Pen's immunity.
He called the gas chambers a detail of history.
That is a crime under German law.
If Parliament lifts his immunity he will be charged.
He will be summoned before the court and if he does not obey this summons he will be arrested if he ever enters the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany again.
Under German law it is a crime to deny Auschwitz or to minimise it.
The purpose of German law is to protect the truth, including the truth about the most terrible epoch of our history!
We must look this horror in the eye.
That is the only way to make sure it never happens again.
That is why German criminal law makes this a punishable crime.
The truth alone can free us, and when we fight against people like Mr Le Pen we are fighting for our own future.
It is not true that this criminal law restricts freedom of expression.
This historical truth is a legally established right that must be protected and it is a universal law.
Nor is it true that it restricts freedom of research.
Over recent years - and I do not want to comment further on this - we have witnessed a long-standing dispute between historians.
This law does not curtail freedom of research either.
What we are most concerned with is protecting young people against the falsifiers of history and the political rabble-rousers.
I am very glad that the far right failed to get in at the recent Bundestag elections in the Federal Republic of Germany.
That is a sign of the maturity of our democracy and it makes me proud of our country!
(Applause)
