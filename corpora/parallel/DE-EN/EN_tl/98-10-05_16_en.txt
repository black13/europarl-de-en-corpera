Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my group has always advocated great caution in regard to waiving the immunity of Members because of the need to protect this Parliament's freedom of expression and powers of control.
The reason I will be voting for the waiver of Mr Le Pen's immunity tomorrow is not because his statements may not be compatible with the exercise of his office.
I am sorry the committee had to resort to that kind of formal decision which, in any case, seems very far-fetched.
The reason I will vote in favour of lifting his immunity is because I would find it intolerable and shameful if this European Parliament protected a Member from being prosecuted for minimising the Holocaust, mocking the surviving victims and insulting the dead, and because I do not believe that this Parliament has any right to allow one of its Members to mock and insult the millions of people who died as a result of this ultimate crime.
If the phrase 'nip it in the bud!' is not to become mere empty words, we cannot grant this kind of Member immunity.
