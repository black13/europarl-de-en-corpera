Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the consumption of drugs, not just in Europe but everywhere, is rising sharply.
I believe we all share the same aim: to protect young people and society as a whole as best we can against drugs and drug consumption.
We are also agreed that we can only combat drugs with a package of measures and that we need to establish a balance between prevention, repression, treatment and rehabilitation.
Anyone who disregards this balance - as Mrs d'Ancona did in her first report in which she called for the decriminalisation of drug consumption and the free sale of cannabis products and heroin on production of a medical certificate, must accept the consequences.
That report was rightly referred back to committee.
Today's report reflects a different approach.
It tries to establish this balance.
It incorporates much of what our drugs expert, Sir Jack Stewart-Clark, proposed and lays great emphasis on the social aspect.
This report can therefore be supported.
But what I find most striking is that amendments have once again been tabled that attempt seriously to disturb that balance and to talk this Parliament into legalising drugs.
That is quite unacceptable!
What we need for the future is for people to realise that prevention will protect.
So let me ask you to support prevention: drugs-free schools for children, for society, but severe punishment for dealers, and aid to help dependent youngsters to get off drugs.
Our only chance to achieve a drugs-free society, a drugs-free life, is by establishing a balance between these three measures.
