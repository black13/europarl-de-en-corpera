Mr President, I would ask for your understanding.
I do not want to delay the proceedings, but both Mr Pirker and Mrs Thors got the facts wrong in their statements.
The report was not referred back by the plenary; instead I asked, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, for it to be taken back from plenary to the committee.
That is a rather different matter.
Members keep implying that the House said: we don't want this rubbish.
The fact is that Mrs d'Ancona requested me to withdraw the report so as to give us an opportunity to negotiate compromises.
That is a considerable difference!
