Mr President, Commissioner, this new proposal for a regulation represents the practical implementation of the European Commission's communication amending the regulation establishing a control system applicable to the common fisheries policy, which we discussed here in the House in September.
We must finally remove some of the weaknesses of the current policy for monitoring fisheries.
That means simplifying the keeping of logbooks in which catches are recorded, more stringent monitoring of landings of catches, careful registration of fisheries products from the catch to the final marketing stage, Commission access to Member State databases, more careful monitoring of fishing vessels flying the flag of a third country and the possibility of inspections without prior notice by Community inspectors in the Member States.
This is a whole package of measures, which we have long called for in the European Parliament.
Now they are to be implemented.
That is why we note today's proposal for a regulation from the Commission with satisfaction.
However, in my view a wide range of problems remains unresolved.
This includes, in particular, the question of a uniform list of penalties for the entire Community.
The penalties applied for infringing the control rules differ from country to country - indeed too much so.
The question of how to measure engine power has not been finally resolved either.
So today's proposal will not be the last amendment of the original proposal, particularly since some very important suggestions were not incorporated, such as involving the fishermen themselves more closely in the monitoring policy - which should, after all, be a matter of course.
Yet we have made quite good headway.
So I thank the rapporteur for his constructive and important report and ask you to endorse it.
