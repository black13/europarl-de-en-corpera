Mr President, Mr Bösch's report is clear in its assessment of the situation and explicit in its demands.
However, I do not consider it helpful to vest the Commission with the power to appoint the staff of OLAF.
The proposal that OLAF should be overseen by an independent five-strong inspectorate, on the other hand, is to be welcomed.
But OLAF would not possess real autonomy as long as the Commission enjoys even indirect authority over OLAF personnel.
Only an independent OLAF, cooperating with the Court of Auditors and, of course, with the Commission and answerable to the European Parliament, will develop into an incisive instrument in the fight against fraud and cooperation.
I believe that an inspectorate operating in a vacuum, as Mr Bösch called it, can indeed be successful if it is endowed with a sufficient number of first-class personnel.
That investment would surely pay dividends.
