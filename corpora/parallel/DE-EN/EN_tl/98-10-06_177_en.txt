Mr President, we know that we spend a great deal of money on the safety of nuclear power stations; that is done under Euratom.
But what is the situation regarding minimum standards?
Are there not even any plans to introduce minimum safety standards for nuclear power stations in the European Union, particularly with the enlargement of the EU in mind?
I believe it is time we all sat down to develop a common programme of safety standards for Europe, one reason being that it could serve as a basis for the applicant states to raise their own standards.
