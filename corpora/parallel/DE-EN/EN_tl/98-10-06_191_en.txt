Mr President, Commissioner, will all those who were admitted to the test this time be admitted next time?
Is there any means of excluding from the next test those who have been unmistakably caught circumventing the rules, because we surely do not want that kind of official in the Commission in future?
Thirdly, is there also scope for reimbursing those candidates who have expended material resources in order to be able to sit this test, who have taken a day off and may therefore have been expected to pay their own travel expenses?
