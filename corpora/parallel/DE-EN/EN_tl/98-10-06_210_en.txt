Mr President, Commissioner, I am a great admirer of the Elche festivals myself, but in this context I should like to ask you something else, because this issue shows how important culture is to our future.
My question is whether it is not time for the Commission to develop a system of its own, not only to catalogue these manifestations of popular culture but also to lend them effective support, so that a new attitude can gradually develop among us.
Since in spirit we are now in Elche, I should also like to refer to the moros y cristianos , in the Provincia de Alicante for example, which are a wonderful piece of popular culture; it might be useful in places like that to encourage people to take more of these initiatives, and the Commission should support them.
Would you be prepared to involve yourselves in that sort of undertaking?
