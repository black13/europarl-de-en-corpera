Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, transport routes have been vital to trade and commerce since time immemorial.
The economic growth of a region and the prosperity of its people depend on opening up trade routes.
Rural areas in particular need an effective transport infrastructure which, together with other infrastructure measures, can prevent rural depopulation and decline.
Products can reach the buyers and consumers, there is more chance of employment in rural areas and that of course boosts competitiveness in general.
That is why we must support a coherent, efficient and safe, but also environmentally compatible transport system in the Union.
But the European Union must also pay attention to link-ups with neighbouring states and the development of the Central and Eastern European countries' transport infrastructure.
Both they and the European Union will profit from improved transport links, since this can further strengthen export and trade.
Under the PHARE and TACIS programmes, interregional and cross-border projects are to be supported.
The rural areas of Central and Eastern Europe need a well thought-out transport infrastructure for their development, to prevent large-scale migration to the towns and to promote employment and economic growth.
But we must realise one thing: within the Union, and in view of enlargement, our priority aim must be to shift traffic to environmentally friendly transport modes.
Here I am thinking in particular of combined transport, rail transport and, above all, inland waterway transport.
