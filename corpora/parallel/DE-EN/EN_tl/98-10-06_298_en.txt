Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, tourism is an important economic sector in the European Union.
It is also important to job creation.
And let me remind you that it is not only urban and coastal tourism that are important, but especially tourism in rural areas.
This brings in extra revenue and also supports regional development.
Of course it also creates jobs, which benefits the entire region.
Priority must be given to soft tourism here.
The European Union ought to create a suitable framework for the future development of tourist policy, as is being discussed in the Philoxenia programme.
Another positive step would be to submit a white paper, following on from the Green Paper, to define the future strategy - not the communitisation of tourist policy but a strategy.
It is important to maintain and promote specific, individual customs and traditions.
I believe that we must give real priority to training those employed in the tourist industry.
To conclude, let me once again protest strongly in this House about sex tourism.
I call on the Commission to do its utmost to combat and finally put a stop to this truly shameful form of tourism.
