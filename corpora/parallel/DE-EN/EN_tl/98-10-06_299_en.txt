Mr President, let me, as a representative of the most tourist-intensive country in the European Union, say a few words on this excellent report.
After all, Austria derives 6 % of its GDP from international tourism.
The domestic pressure of competition is enormous, as a result of extremely cheap offers in areas with good climatic conditions.
Tourist companies are faced with a totally uncoordinated and inefficient EU tourism policy.
There is no uniform concept of tourism.
Twice now the Council has rejected the Philoxenia programme, which offers some really positive ideas.
In my view, this kind of action programme should obey the principle of subsidiarity and give priority to advertising particular regions, because I believe that would be the best way to find third-country customers for the European market.
The report calls on the budgetary authority to make a functioning budget available for direct Community measures for 1999.
Budget line B5-325 is the only one that refers explicitly to measures to promote tourism.
Then it emerges that this budget line, which was virtually non-existent in the past given that it only accounted for ECU 2 million, is to be cut even more under the Council and Commission proposals.
That is incredible when you think that the Commission described tourism as one of the five economic factors most likely to create jobs.
Tourism is to be promoted via the Structural Funds and various Community initiatives that were not originally geared to tourism.
As the Commission report shows, this results in an unfair distribution of resources, which is a serious disadvantage to Austria, among others.
