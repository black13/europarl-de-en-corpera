Mr President, the report presented to us is an excellent catalogue of all the financial implications that the introduction of the euro will have for the European Union.
Permit me, nevertheless, to observe that the report perhaps has one weakness in so far as it does not indicate that the abolition of the present agrimonetary system will release a large sum of money from which the Member States ought to benefit.
The stringent savings packages adopted by the EU Member States in preparation for the euro have drastically reduced the volume of public investments in Europe, thereby contributing to a rise in unemployment.
As we all know, public investment in Europe is at a very low level.
In order to strengthen public confidence and thus to achieve increased consumption in Europe, every effort must be made to ensure that the Member States can benefit from the funds released by the introduction of the euro to finance measures designed to combat unemployment.
The total savings should therefore be specifically used to fund a practical reduction in the Member States' contributions to enable them to take special measures to combat unemployment.
