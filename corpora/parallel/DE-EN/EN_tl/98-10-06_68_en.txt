Madam President, I would ask you to examine, as a matter of urgency, whether this European Parliament is a platform for speeches that repeat the same thing time and again, the selfsame thing for which Mr Le Pen has been cited.
My blood boils, my stomach turns and I am deeply saddened to think that anyone here can desecrate the memory of the Holocaust victims by conducting a debate of this kind.
May I ask you to consider urgently whether we cannot restrict this platform to one such speaker rather than permitting all of them to speak.
