Mr President, Commissioner, I am glad that the Commission is considering the option of cofinancing agricultural policy.
Cofinancing agricultural policy is, I believe, the right way forward.
This proposal attacks the nub of the problem, because it takes the expenditure side of the budget as its starting-point.
In addition, as has already been said, this option can be decided by a qualified majority in the Council and does not require a unanimously agreed revision of the decision on own resources.
The discussion on net contributors, led by the former Minister of Finance, Mr Waigel, can thus confidently be consigned to history, along with the Finance Minister.
If the Member States were to pay for half of the direct subsidies in the agriculture budget out of their own pockets, Germany would make a net saving of DEM 2 400 million.
The United Kingdom would also stand to benefit considerably from a reform of this kind, to the tune of around DEM 2 000 million.
The British rebate would thus be rendered obsolete.
If some of the financial burden were transferred from the Union to the Member States, then the EU budget would also have to be reduced by the same amount.
Otherwise, there would be an outright increase in the EU budget, which would meet with resistance, in Germany too, from those who then had to pay for cofinancing out of their own pockets.
In my opinion, there should be no question of using the resources released to fund trans-European networks and research policy, as a kind of European employment programme.
Responsibility for large-scale employment policy must continue to lie with the Member States; it is not possible to fund this at European level.
