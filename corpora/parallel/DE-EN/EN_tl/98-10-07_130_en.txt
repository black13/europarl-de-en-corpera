Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are all agreed that the pressure of immigration from or via North Africa to Europe is dramatically increasing.
We are also agreed that it is the southern Member States that are most affected by it.
The reasons for the migratory pressures are sufficiently well-known - I do not want to go through them here again, as we are all aware of them.
But the southern Member States are not the only ones affected, all the European countries subsequently are, because as a rule, the destination countries lie further north.
Germany and Austria are the first in line, and their ability to take people in and to integrate them are limited.But what is the Union doing?
At present, we still do not have uniform or adequate instruments to meet the full extent of these new challenges.
We have the Geneva Convention, but we know that this is no longer enough, because only 10 % of those who come to us are treated as asylum-seekers in accordance with it.
We need other instruments and concepts for the remainder, in order to be able to help both them and ourselves.
Here, I would like particularly to thank the President-in-Office for presenting a very comprehensive concept, developed with total responsibility.
I am glad that you have mentioned the need, for instance, to reduce the pressure for migration through intervention in the crisis regions, to combat trafficking in human beings, and to regulate immigration.
We are not a fortress, but in the interests of eventual integration, immigration must be limited and controlled.
Legal checks on entry were mentioned as a general concept for the Union, and so was new protection for refugees, because first and foremost, we need a division of the burden to enable integration and transitional entry to Europe.
We need a completely new overall concept that will produce these solutions.
I am confident that this is the beginning of a discussion that will end positively for the whole of Europe.
