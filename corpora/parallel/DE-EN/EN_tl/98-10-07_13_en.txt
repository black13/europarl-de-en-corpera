Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have the impression that the topic of Malta came as rather a surprise, not only to you, Commissioner van den Broek, but also to you, Madam President-in-Office, because I had actually expected you to comment briefly on this in your statement.
As vice-chairman of the Malta Delegation, I do, however, appreciate the opportunity to discuss this issue here today.
Admittedly, I had expected a rather clearer signal from the Council, given the remarks the Commission made in the Committee on Foreign Affairs and Security, which were, even at that stage, along the same lines as those it made today.
The Council now tells us that it is waiting for a Commission communication, so as to first ascertain its assessment of the situation.
The procedure is rather bewildering, because on other enlargement issues, the Council has always taken the initiative.
Indeed, perhaps it is also the Council that should take some responsibility for the somewhat confused situation, because it gave Malta the brush-off and said that its turn would come after the preceding enlargement.
Malta was then, as it were, catapulted into the ranks of those countries which are experiencing severe difficulties in preparing for accession to the European Union.
In the two intervening years, Malta has not closed any doors.
The government, too, in the meantime, has done all it can to give a subsequent government, of whatever political hue, the possibility to reactivate its application for membership.
Besides, the Commission must certainly also have been aware of these signals from Malta, through the regular reports of its delegation.
The intention of our motion for a resolution is to call on the Council to send out a clear and immediate signal, first of all, to indicate that it welcomes Malta and that Malta is now once again a part of the European Conference.
For Malta belongs in this forum, if only because of its constructive role in the Barcelona process.
