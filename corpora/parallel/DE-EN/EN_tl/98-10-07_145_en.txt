Madam President, the Asian, and particularly the Chinese, economic area holds immense potential for the European Union.
Without a doubt, Hong Kong plays a key political as well as economic role as regards links with the region.
That is why good relations with the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region are of great importance for the European economy.
The EU must undertake every necessary effort to foster appropriate contacts, and above all to speak out against the alarming anti-democratic tendencies cited in the report, and the lack of constitutionality which has been justifiably criticised.
Only a democratic order based on the rule of law can be regarded as the guarantor of a permanently independent Hong Kong economy.
On the issue of visa-free access to the Schengen area, I cannot agree with the rapporteur's current request for this to be given to all HKSAR and BNO passport holders.
In my opinion, this question should be treated separately, as the Commission has suggested.
