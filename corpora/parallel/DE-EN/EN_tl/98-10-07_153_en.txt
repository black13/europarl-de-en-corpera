Mr President, Mrs McKenna, our remit is clearly laid defined.
I have just explained - and I would like to stress this once again - that the Council is not authorised to say anything about the conduct of police forces as regards measures to uphold public order in the sovereign territory of a given Member State.
I would emphasise again, if it is necessary to do so, that only the competent authorities of the individual state have the power to judge police behaviour in that Member State.
Mrs McKenna's question would therefore probably meet with a greater reaction if it were to be asked in the UK House of Commons.
However, there is something I can add: there is the Council of Europe and the European Convention on Human Rights, and complaints can also be made to the European Commission of Human Rights.
