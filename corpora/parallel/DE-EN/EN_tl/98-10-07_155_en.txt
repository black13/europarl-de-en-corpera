Mr President, Mr Ephremidis, I have to tell you once again that we only have certain powers.
The Council is indeed responsible for external relations and that is why it can talk about a lack of press freedom in a third country.
It is not responsible, however, for internal matters, such as the conduct of police forces in a Member State.
I can only repeat the answer that I gave a short while ago to Mrs McKenna.
