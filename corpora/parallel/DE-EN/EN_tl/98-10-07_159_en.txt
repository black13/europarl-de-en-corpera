Mr President, Mr Camis√≥n Asensio, these are questions of detail that you are putting to the Council.
In view of the explanations already given, I would refer you to the Commission, which will provide you with more precise information on exact amounts and specific questions, especially as to whether or not this also falls under INTERREG.
I cannot, unfortunately, provide any oral information on this but if you wish, I would be happy to answer in writing.
