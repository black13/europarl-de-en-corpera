Mr President, Madam President-in-Office, I have to be honest with you - I have one specific problem with the entire Dayton Agreement, and it is that one of the parties to it is Mr Milosevic.
In the course of the last few years we have seen that he is not at all willing to keep to any part of the agreement.
There has been very minor progress in a few areas.
The greatest advances by far which, while not being enough, at least represent progress have come from the Croats.
They have set up a consulate in Banja Luka and made rapid changes to the law, especially as far as the right of abode of certain persons in Krajina and West Slavonia is concerned.
Big concessions have been made on the Croat side.
But basically, as long as the other party is Milosevic - and we are seeing at the moment what is happening in Kosovo - I have to say honestly that the Dayton Agreements have no real value, aside from the symbolic.
We should consider the possibility of deferring certain elements of the agreement as long as he is one of the parties to it.
