Mr President, Mr Habsburg-Lothringen, there are a good number of areas in which the Dayton Agreements have certainly brought advantages.
The most important is probably that, through the Agreement, we have managed for the first time to consolidate the ceasefire and give the different parties the chance to live with one another again.
But of course not everything is perfect, particularly as far as Milosevic is concerned, and we are aware of that.
I just think that there were hardly any other alternatives under the circumstances.
To suspend the Dayton Agreements now is, to my mind, not a good alternative either.
The civil society and democracy must be strengthened.
For that, I think that both the media and the electoral system need to be reformed and, as you know, there is a whole series of projects which are designed to do just that.
The continuation of the economic reforms is another reason why Bosnia and Herzegovina should still receive support from the international community.
As for the constitutional state, the creation of an independent multi-ethnic judiciary, a professional multi-ethnic police force, and resistance to all forms of parallel structure are also prerequisites for a democratic Bosnia and Herzegovina, and here I think that the international community has achieved something in the last few years.
I do not say everything, and I do not say that the situation there could not be improved a great deal in a few years time, but I think that we must continue the fight to strengthen the joint institutions and reform the Council of Ministers, and to set up an authority to monitor the revenue of the state and of the territorial units.
