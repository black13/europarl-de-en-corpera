Mr President, Mrs Flemming, of course it is true that some countries, like Austria for instance, have taken in refugees, not only from Bosnia, but also elsewhere, and have done so quite generously.
Today, in the discussion on migrants, I told you that 85 000 to 90 000 have been admitted to Austria.
That is equivalent to 8-9 % of the Austrian population.
Nevertheless, our goal must be to return the refugees as far as possible.
It is their home and they must rebuild their own country.
Of course, the return depends on how fast we are able to build up the economy there, so that they can find work, and how quickly we can create security so that they have some guarantees when they go back to their country.
