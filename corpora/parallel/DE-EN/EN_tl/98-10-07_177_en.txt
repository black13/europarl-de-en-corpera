Mr President, Mr Salafranca Sanchez-Neyra, allow me to start by saying that I myself first met Cuba's Foreign Minister in New York, both as President-in-Office of the Council and also of course as Austria's State Secretary.
On that occasion, it was noticeable that Cuba seemed willing - and I deliberately say 'seemed' because it remains untested - to accept a type of dialogue similar to the EU-China human rights dialogue if necessary.
We are currently considering this.
I believe that a new form of dialogue could naturally have positive effects on EU-Cuba relations, and also perhaps on the EU/US/Cuba triangle.
As to the detail of your question, I have to tell you that at the moment a change in the position I have outlined is not likely.
But as I said, if I have interpreted things correctly, I can see some fairly positive opportunities for the future.
