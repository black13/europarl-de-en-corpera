Mr President, Mr Newens, the European Union is greatly interested in improving transatlantic relations and especially in foreign policy cooperation, and differences in opinion on Cuba should not impair the effectiveness of these.
The EU's policy here consists of two main features.
Firstly, dissuading the US from internationalising bilateral problems - in this case between the US and Cuba - by applying extraterritorial legislation.
Secondly, persuading the US that the critical-but-cooperative dialogue between the EU and Cuba is more successful in the longer term for the international community's relations with Cuba than the US approach of bringing pressure to bear and of threats.
That would be my response to your question.
