Mr President, Mrs González Álvarez, allow me to state my view on this once more.
At the end of May 1998, Cuba claimed that with the summit agreements the EU had in fact accepted the principle of extraterritoriality it had always previously fought against.
Most importantly, the provisions of the Helms-Burton Act which had resulted in numerous restrictions on trade and transport remained in force and therefore the extraterritorial nature of the US embargo was essentially intact.
According to Havana, the only thing which the US offered in return was a vague undertaking to the EU by the US Administration that they would try to have Titles III and IV of the Helms-Burton Act waived.
Cuba also warned the EU at the beginning of June 1998 against inciting opposition groups and human rights activists.
Such subversive activities would not be accepted by the Cuban administration and could result in appropriate measures being taken.
But the US is increasingly asking for this type of commitment, to demonstrate to the US Congress and to the American people that the EU is not distancing itself from the central statements of the common position.
Of course the EU will not accept that anything in the package of measures agreed at the London summit in any way vindicates the principles of the Liberty Act, particularly not the imposition of a secondary boycott and retroactive legislation with extraterritorial effect.
This is the position of the Commission and the Member States.
As I have already mentioned, the issue of expropriation has been commented on by Sir Leon Brittan.
