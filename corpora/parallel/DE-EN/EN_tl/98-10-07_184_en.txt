Mr President, Madam President-in-Office, I regret the fact that my question has lost some of its relevance since it was submitted - this has all become common knowledge in the meantime.
Of course I have followed the discussion here this afternoon, and I am glad to have the information available at present confirmed by an authoritative source.
But let me ask a supplementary question.
If I take what you have said and what you explained in detail this afternoon about withdrawing parts of the paper, and turn the argument on its head, can I assume that the wording used in Articles 41 and 132 is still valid?
They say that a shift towards less constitutional and more politically-oriented concepts of protection in the field of asylum would also be perfectly feasible.
If this is the case, then I would very much like to know what the Council position is.
