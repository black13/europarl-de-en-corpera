Mr President, Mr Hager, I cannot now respond in detail on each piece of drafting, because I do not have the text in front of me.
I can only tell you that we gave a discussion paper to the press and another paper was discussed in the press even before it was made official.
That led to certain misunderstandings.
A paper which is to be officially debated by various bodies is of course not going to contain wording that could be offensive in any way.
I have already explained that there was a certain misunderstanding - we clearly never intended to do away with the Geneva Convention.
But it needs to be expanded in certain areas, as I explained in our discussion today.
Secondly, this is not a new subject.
In 1991 it was discussed for the first time, and in 1992 and 1994 it was taken up by the Commission.
As our discussion has shown, this question is certainly extremely complex today.
On the one hand we have to find a way to combat the despicable trade of trafficking in human beings, while on the other we must also find a way to create humanitarian possibilities for refugees, and take in those people who are most in need of help.
