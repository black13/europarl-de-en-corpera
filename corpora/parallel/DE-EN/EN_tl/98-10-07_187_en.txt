Mr President, Mr Sj√∂stedt, I do not think it is very sensible for us to enter into discussion on a paper that is not even officially before us, and in which the positions of the other Member States have only just been included.
We really must wait until the paper is officially forwarded to the European Parliament and then we can hold a discussion on it.
