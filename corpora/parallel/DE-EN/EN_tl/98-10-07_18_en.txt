Mr President, when examining Malta's application for membership, which the Commissioner has confirmed has been resurrected, the Union must, I believe, take into account the following points in particular: firstly, consideration should be given to whether, from the point of view of its infrastructure, Malta is in any kind of a position to run a Council presidency.
A similarly small country such as Luxembourg, for example, cooperates with Belgium in this respect.
No such possibility is open to Malta.
Secondly, I believe that it is essential that value added tax, which has been abolished in Malta, should be reintroduced.
While other Member States are obliged to have a minimum rate of 15 %, a derogation clause on this point would put this country, when it accedes, at an unacceptable competitive advantage.
But, with your permission, I will close with a general comment on the value of the European Conference.
This instrument was created, as a matter of urgency, as a forum for dialogue between the EU and Turkey.
The fact that this state has again failed to participate should give EU strategists cause to rethink their policy on this matter.
