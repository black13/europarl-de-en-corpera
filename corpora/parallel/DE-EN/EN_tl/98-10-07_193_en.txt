Mr President, Mr McCartin, as I have already explained in my earlier reply with particular regard to the car sector, the Commission has adopted a number of rules to ensure that there is transparency in car prices across the whole of Europe.
In this connection, it would be useful to point out that under Chapter 5 of the Treaty, common rules on competition are the particular responsibility of the Commission, and as you rightly suspected, it would be in a position to answer your questions considerably better and in more detail.
In the insurance field, I would refer the Honourable Member to Directive 92/49/EEC, which aims to regulate activity in this sector and ensure greater competition.
If it is established nevertheless that distortions in the car market are occurring, then of course the Council will devote its full attention to any proposals the Commission deems necessary to remedy matters appropriately.
