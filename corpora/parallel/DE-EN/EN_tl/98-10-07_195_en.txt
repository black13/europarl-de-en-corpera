Mr President, Mr RÃ¼big, the only thing I can really say to that is yes, of course.
I think it will certainly increase competitiveness.
It will naturally also mean stronger competition and lower prices, because better comparability will allow consumers to look all the more carefully at where they actually buy.
I believe that the introduction of the euro will definitely have positive effects for the consumer in the long term.
