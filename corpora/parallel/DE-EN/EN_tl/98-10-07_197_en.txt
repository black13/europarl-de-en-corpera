Mr President, Mr Alavanos, I quite understand the problem you have raised here like the honourable Member who spoke before you.
Let me point out once again that it is the Commission's job, not the Council's, to see that the single market functions smoothly and that the rules on competition are respected.
Allow me also to remind you that fixing insurance premiums falls within the remit of Member States.
As for the completion of a single market for insurance, I would once again request the Member to contact the Commission, because that is the body responsible for ensuring that individual rules on competition are complied with.
Incidentally, I would be happy to pass this on to them.
