Mr President, I only have one question.
You have been very politically balanced in whom you have called upon to speak, but I wanted to ask why, when we were on the very thorny issue of the Austrian strategy paper, you only gave the floor to two representatives of the Socialist Group, although I was the first to raise my hand the very second when you took requests for the floor and before you stopped taking them.
The President-in-Office may therefore have received the inaccurate impression that there were only critics of the paper here.
There are also strong supporters of it!
But that was not reflected here at all.
