Mr President, Mrs Karamanou, allow me once again to point out that the matter you have raised is an especially important one for the Austrian Presidency too.
We have also taken a series of initiatives in this area.
Before I go into more detail, I should like to tell you that this very issue was discussed at the European conference which took place just yesterday in Luxembourg, and which I reported on this morning.
We are beginning to discuss this important problem and look for solutions not only in the EU context, but also with all the applicant countries.
Significantly, Europol's powers have been extended to include this area.
The aim is not just to create more bureaucracy, but to try to fight this evil that you correctly identify together and effectively.
I would point out that in the last two years the Council has already adopted countless decisions that are now being applied.
I would just mention the following: two joint actions, from 29 November 1996 and 24 February 1997, for an exchange programme and measures to combat trafficking in people and the sexual exploitation of children; extending Europol's mandate to include the prevention of and fight against trafficking in people, as I said before; the 28 April 1997 action plan for fighting organised crime; the EU-US common initiative against trafficking in women (it seems to us important that this issue has now been taken up in the transatlantic dialogue); and finally the Council conclusions of 19 March 1998 on 10 principles for an action plan proposed by the G8 to combat crime in the leading sectors of technology.
