Mr President, Mrs Thors, I believe that I have tried to underline how much this Presidency in particular sees this problem as related to the larger one of the fight against organised crime.
On 1-3 October the Austrian Presidency organised a conference in Vienna for eastern and western countries on the trade in women, which the EU Commissioner for Immigration, Home Affairs and Justice, Anita Gradin, attended.
Its aim was to inform the public about the basic and country-specific organisation of trafficking in women, and to offer the representatives of NGOs and of national and international institutions the opportunity to exchange experiences in the field of prevention and intervention and to develop further strategies to fight trafficking in women in eastern and western Europe.
The European Parliament and the Commission are to run a campaign next year against violence against women.
The Austrian Presidency has also organised a conference on the work of the police against violence against women.
It will be held from 30 November to 4 December of this year in Baden and aims to contribute to the preparation of Member States' activities for 1999.
The conference intends, in the light of international experience, to raise the issue of standards which are in keeping with the times and to look at good examples of measures taken to combat acts of violence perpetrated by men against women.
It will looked in particular at the situation women are faced with in criminal proceedings when they have become the victims of domestic violence, the specific aspects of violence against female migrants and their special need for protection because of their legal and economic situation as foreigners, and the impact of each of these on the work of the police.
I have already explained how important this subject was at the European conference, particularly in view of the need for future EU member countries to find joint solutions to this problem.
