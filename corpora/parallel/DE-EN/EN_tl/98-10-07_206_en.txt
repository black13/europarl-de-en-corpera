Mr President, as you know, many criminal acts are now perpetrated on the Internet.
This is also true of child prostitution and trafficking in women, and the trade in organs which often goes with them.
We now know that the DAPHNE programme is to be launched for a longer period up to the year 2004, and that it is to be quite generously funded.
My question is, since so much crime goes on through the Internet, can we think about setting up a kind of cyber-police to monitor communication on the Internet and take appropriate countermeasures as a remedy and to combat crime?
