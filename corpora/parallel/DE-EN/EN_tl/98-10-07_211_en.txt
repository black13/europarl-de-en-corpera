Mr President, Mrs Thors, firstly of course I share your concern about the level of employment and about the need to combat unemployment wherever possible.
That is not in question.
At this time of economic globalisation the Council is particularly aware that everything must be done in order to maintain the level of employment and if possible to raise it even further.
In fact, the Council is of the view that the employment issue constitutes the greatest challenge for the EU at the turn of the millennium.
I personally am deeply convinced that the future generation of Europeans is going to measure Community policy by the success it achieves against the scourge of unemployment.
That is why for the time being, I can only reiterate that this is of course an extremely complex and multifaceted problem, which needs to be very closely examined in relation to all the implications tied up with it.
That is what is presently happening.
It is currently under review, and a suitable proposal will be put forward at the appropriate time.
But because of the complexity of the situation it is too early at the moment to make specific statements on content.
