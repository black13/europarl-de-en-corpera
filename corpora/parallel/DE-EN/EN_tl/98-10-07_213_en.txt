Mr President, Mr Lindqvist, you know that the Austrian Presidency in particular attaches the greatest importance to fighting unemployment, and that we intend to draw up specific guidelines for the European Council which should be approved at the European Council in Vienna.
I do not have all the details in front of me right now, but these are primarily based on the best practice, as it is called, of the different countries.
In other words, we learn from each other.
At the moment we are also looking at how additional jobs have been created in the various countries.
I am thinking here of the great flexibility and mobility in Holland and the Austrian model of 'dual training' which involves both an apprenticeship and vocational school - theory and practice alongside each other - and which has made us the leaders in youth employment.
Similar ideas are being looked at very closely by experts, so that models that other countries have found useful can also be taken on by others.
This is the direction which the Austrian Presidency's guidelines on fighting unemployment take.
