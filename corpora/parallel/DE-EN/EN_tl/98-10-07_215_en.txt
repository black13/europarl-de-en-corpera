Mr President, Mr McCartin, thank you very much for that comment.
You are right of course that the measures that are now being discussed will have an impact within the whole context of globalisation.
On the issue of reducing labour costs - how would this be passed on?
These questions are also particularly important in the framework of the Lom√© negotiations that we have just begun.
Of course I cannot go into details on this question now - I am not really an expert on these financial negotiations - but I can tell you that you were right in making the point that every aspect of tax management naturally has a major effect on the entire global economy.
