Madam President, we in the Green Group were very concerned at the Court's decision to freeze the budget line for consumer activities.
What we in fact wanted was for these activities to be expanded and more resources to be allocated.
For us that is the crucial point.
We support the Commission proposal.
However, we believe it is most important that resources are made available not just to the classic consumer organisations but also to the NGOs.
May I remind you that in the Federal Republic very considerable resources are spent on an advertising campaign to promote meat as a vital energy source.
But there we are talking about marketing companies, which must not be confused with consumer organisations.
So the aim must be genuinely to strengthen the consumer organisations, which also means that key consumer protection organisations must receive funding from that budget line.
But this must not lead to funds being diverted from, for instance, the action programme concerning environment-related diseases or from activities in favour of consumers.
So we consider it most important that key consumer organisations also benefit from these resources.
The money really must be used to inform the consumer and not to market certain products in the European Union to the benefit of industry.
The consumers need these resources, because they have a great need for information.
