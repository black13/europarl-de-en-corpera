Madam President, Commissioner, even as one who is well aware of the reservations about introducing single judge decisions by the Court of First Instance put forward during the discussion in the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, and has now heard them repeated, let me on behalf of my group plead for adoption of the Martin report, now that the Committee on Institutional Affairs has decided to do so too.
My reasons are these.
The initiative for the new ruling comes from the Court itself, which set out its views in some detail in the Legal Affairs Committee.
The new rules can only be applied after a Chamber decision, i.e. only on the basis of a Chamber decision.
Their scope is so carefully circumscribed that there is no risk of legal uncertainty.
These new rules on single judge decisions cannot be replaced by any other potential proposals with regard to the composition of the Court of Justice.
My other reason is, I believe, the most important one, and perhaps I can remind you of it even at this near-midnight hour: the European Union has to prepare itself for tasks on a quite different scale, not least with regard to its jurisdiction, in view of the forthcoming accession of the Central and Eastern European countries.
