Mr President, this is not really related to the Minutes, but today I must once again draw your attention to a very unpleasant state of affairs in Brussels.
Two weeks ago, at 7.30 p.m., one of my assistants was attacked in the vicinity of Parliament.
I really do think that action should finally be taken - in the interests of Brussels and Belgium as well - to stop this kind of thing happening!
I would also ask you to bear in mind that New York was once one of the most dangerous cities in the world, and within a short space of time has become one of the safest.
I believe that all of us who work in the institutions have a right to live and work in safe surroundings!
(Applause)
