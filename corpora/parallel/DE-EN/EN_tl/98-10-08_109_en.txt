Madam President, the elections which took place in Slovakia on 25 and 26 September have caused a major upset.
The Slovak population has demonstrated political maturity by voting out Prime Minister Meciar and giving the Democratic Coalition a majority vote.
This is a departure from post-communist despotism and represents a particular success for our sister party, the Christian Democrats, who are the main political force in the new government.
The European Parliament, therefore, rightly congratulates the Slovak population on the results of this election.
There are grounds for hoping that a strong and stable government will now be formed quickly.
The victorious opposition, the Slovak Democratic Coalition (SDK), has found its feet in the determination to oust Meciar.
It unites such different forces as Christian Democrats, Liberals, the reformed Communist Left and the Party of the Hungarian Coalition.
It is a heterogeneous group which is going to have to work to maintain its cohesion.
However, there is a strong chance that it can create a government which fulfils the Copenhagen accession criteria, particularly in terms of achieving institutional stability as a guarantee of democracy based on the rule of law, of respect for human rights and of respect for and the protection of minorities.
There are now calls for the European Union to support Slovakia so that it can fulfil the political criteria for accession.
The political change in this country favours the integration of Slovakia into the European Union and represents a welcome element of stability in Central Europe.
