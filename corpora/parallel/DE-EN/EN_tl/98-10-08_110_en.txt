Madam President, the European Parliament has repeatedly expressed its dissatisfaction with the progress of democracy in Slovakia, which was also the reason it was not included in the first group of accession countries.
However, I believe that anyone expressing dissatisfaction and criticism should also be prepared to recognise change and progress and to assess them fairly.
The elections in Slovakia were fair and correct, as I observed for myself.
The question for us now is whether the Union is capable of responding to this situation quickly and firmly and of assessing it appropriately.
I believe that the current resolution is too vague, too 'wait and see', too cautious.
My group believes it is possible to bring Slovakia into the first group sooner, particularly given that the new forces of democracy could use all the support they can get not only on the path to democracy but also on the path to Europe.
