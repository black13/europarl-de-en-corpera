Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, 84 % voter turn-out speaks for itself.
I myself was in Slovakia for three days as election observer, and the enthusiasm of the Slovak people when they went to the polls was tangible.
I was also very pleased to note that the political representatives at the polling stations had had excellent training.
Training sessions often lasted up to five hours, and the use of videos ensured maximum preparation for the elections.
Young people were palpably pleased to vote in this election and it was clear that the official representatives, who regarded each other with great scepticism, really did monitor procedures right to the end.
It is for these reasons that I believe this election was a huge step forward for Slovakia.
Today, we can confirm with a clear conscience that the elections took place in a correct and objective manner, that new majorities were made possible and that Slovakia now has a real opportunity to forge ahead on the path to Europe.
We noticed that the Slovak population were very pro-Europe.
Another vote took place at the same time as these elections and had a very low turn-out, yet 84 % voted in the election involving the 17 parties that stood, so we know that the Slovak people had both practical and emotional reasons for voting the way they did.
I also call upon the Commission to ensure that Slovakia's democratic election leads to appropriate action being taken.
