Madam President, we have not had a great deal of good news in Europe in recent times.
At last, a real ray of hope has come from Slovakia; shortly before the elections, during which I was also present, the people really did not believe that they could win.
It is incredibly encouraging for us that these people were able to assert themselves against such a brutal power.
Mr Meciar really was a brutal potential dictator.
I spoke to him several times, and I have to say that I came away with the impression that the man is a medical problem rather than a political one!
However, this is dangerous for all of us.
We should now do everything in our power to enable the Slovak people, good people who have survived a tough history, to join the European Union as soon as possible.
We must ask the governments to do their best to ensure that the relevant decision is adopted at the summit in Vienna, which incidentally is only a few minutes away from Slovakia.
