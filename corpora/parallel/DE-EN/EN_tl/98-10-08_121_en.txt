Madam President, in 1994 the European Parliament awarded the Sakharov Prize to Taslima Nasreen.
In her book 'Lajja', which roughly means 'feelings of shame', she described the life of a Hindu family and outlined Muslim extremism, intolerance towards the Hindu minority and everyday discrimination against women in a male-dominated world.
The book was banned in her own country.
Anyone accused of injuring religious feelings can expect a prison sentence of up to two years.
After four years, Mrs Nasreen came out of exile and is back in Bangladesh.
Was it recklessness that drove her to do this?
On her Internet website she gives her reasons for returning home.
One is homesickness and attachment to a country that is much too important to be allowed to fall into the hands of extremists.
The other is her mother who is seriously ill with cancer.
She wants to be with her in what will probably be the last weeks of her life.
Almost as soon as Mrs Nasreen arrived in Bangladesh under a false name and went into hiding, the streets were full of soldiers.
We have reliable reports of serious outbreaks of violence.
A reward has been offered, as Mr Telk√§mper mentioned, and demands for her death are circulating once again, initiated by fanatical Muslim extremists.
So Taslima Nasreen's life is once again in danger.
It is still unclear how long the government, regarded as liberal, can hold its ground against the fundamentalists.
We call upon the Prime Minister, Mrs Hasina, to apply the human rights enshrined in the constitution and to protect Mrs Nasreen.
The demands for her to present herself voluntarily before the courts is a double-edged one, given the possibility of a prison sentence, uncontrollable pressure and the danger of attacks by extremists who are almost impossible to keep in check.
I hope, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, that the Sakharov Prize has the necessary international standing to finally help to free this brave fighter from danger.
