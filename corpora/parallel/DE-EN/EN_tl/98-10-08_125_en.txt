Madam President, Commissioner, we have recently heard repeated reports from the media about the terrible ill-treatment of the deputy prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, and the utterly grotesque accusations against him.
A representative of the Adenauer Foundation had the opportunity to visit him a few days ago and was able to confirm our worst fears.
I think we should take a brief look at the history of Malaysia and point out what Tunku Abdul Rahman, the founder of an independent Malaysia and one of the greatest figures in the whole of Asia, said about Mahathir Mohamad 15 years ago.
He warned people against him and said that he was a great demagogue who could bring disaster to Malaysia.
In my opinion, our worst fears about Mahathir Mohamad have proved to be true.
He is one of the greatest demagogues and perhaps one of the greatest experts when it comes to pushing aside troublesome rivals or unseating others who come to power.
The last obstacle to his seizing full power in Malaysia was undoubtedly deputy prime minister Anwar, one of the greatest economic experts in the whole region.
He was regarded by several newspapers as one of the genuine hopes for the future of Malaysia, and he was also someone who might actually have achieved something, particularly in these times of serious economic crisis.
Of course, the Anwar case also shows us that something is wrong with Malaysia's basic laws.
It has already been stated that under the Internal Security Act people can be detained without a warrant, for an investigation period of up to 60 days, if they are suspected - only suspected, mind you - of threatening Malaysia's national security or economy.
Furthermore, the Minister of Home Affairs may issue a detention order of two years without any significant reason.
We must protest against this and stand up for this man.
