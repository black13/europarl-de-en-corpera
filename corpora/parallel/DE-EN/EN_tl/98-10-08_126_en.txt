Madam President, in recent years Malaysia has enjoyed the benefits of being at the centre of the economic boom, and human rights violations have not been a central issue, any more so than the Internal Security Act, a law from the colonial period.
For as long as I have been in this Parliament, we have criticised this law as being clear proof that Malaysia is not a democratic constitutional state.
We have now been alarmed by the arrest of Anwar Ibrahim, the former deputy prime minister, and a further eleven people who were detained with him under the Internal Security Act, and by the arrest of Mr Nallakarupan, a businessman.
We fear that they have been subjected to ill-treatment during their detention.
Why?
This Internal Security Act is an arbitrary law.
People can be arrested simply on suspicion.
They can be held in detention and then imprisoned for two years, which can be extended indefinitely.
Currently, 200 people appear to be held in detention, and we demand their immediate release.
We also condemn the Malaysian penal code, under which homosexual acts between consenting adults are punishable by up to 20 years' imprisonment and whipping.
Some people have been imprisoned on these grounds, and we call upon the government to act in a constitutional manner and to release these people immediately.
