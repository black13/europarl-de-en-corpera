Mr President, the issue here - the eternal persecution of the Baha'is - is similar to one mentioned earlier.
The Iranians always say that these people are enemies of the country as the core of the Baha'i religion is actually based in Israel.
This is the pretext that is always used.
We should do everything in our power to help the Baha'is to regain the religious freedom that they had before Khomeini seized power, and the freedom to which they should be entitled once again.
There have been positive signs, but unfortunately the opportunity passed all too quickly.
I would strongly urge that we should begin our protests once again, as they helped in the past.
If we continue they should help this time too.
