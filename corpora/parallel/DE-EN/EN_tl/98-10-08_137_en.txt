Mr President, the Leyla Zana case is unfortunately symptomatic of the whole Kurdish problem in Turkey.
When we go there we are told by the PKK that this is the last battle.
The Turkish side answers with the same argument, that it is the last advance against the PKK.
There are several reasons why a solution has not yet been reached.
On the one hand, the Kurdish forces are fragmented; on the other hand, there are areas of withdrawal and also support from outside.
Therefore, I support the resolution, which demands that a political solution be found, as a military solution has so far not succeeded.
The current situation, in which there is considerable tension between Turkey and Syria, shows how dangerous it is to delay a political solution.
I myself once visited Leyla Zana in prison.
She was paraded as their star inmate.
I find it outrageous that a country that aspires to join the EU should imprison people because of their political beliefs.
