Mr President, we have already discussed various human rights issues at length.
Georgia, however, is quite a special case.
In April of this year the UN human rights section examined the case of certain prisoners in detail, obviously with the aim of setting an example for others, since it is the general treatment of people in Georgia's prisons that is simply scandalous.
I was co-opted into the Georgia Helsinki Group a long time ago, and as a result I receive information directly.
It is shocking what people are going through there.
This was why it was good that the UN dealt with this.
It wrote a report, which was adopted by the UN, calling on the Georgian Government to put an end to this scandalous situation, particularly with regard to the three people I have named in the resolution.
Since then nothing has happened.
The UN has made several inquiries but there has been no reply from Georgia.
The government remains silent.
In my opinion, it is now time for us Europeans to have a say.
After all, we must not forget that Georgia listens to us very seriously.
Therefore, it would almost be a service to Georgia if we were to take up this issue and call upon the Georgian Government, as stated in the resolution, to finally comply with the UN's proposals following lengthy, serious studies based on a broad range of evidence.
I only hope that the resolution is adopted in its current form, because I believe it can really achieve something.
