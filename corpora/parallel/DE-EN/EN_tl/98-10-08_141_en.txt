Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr von Habsburg has already said that we have a fundamental problem here.
As we have seen, the signing of partnership, cooperation and interim agreements does not automatically improve the human rights situation in the partner countries in the manner provided for by European Commission of Human Rights.
Although the Commission always claims that these agreements are necessary in order to help improve the human rights situation, this is not the case.
Nothing is being done.
The interim agreement with Georgia was signed a long time ago and nothing has happened.
I believe that, particularly when a democratic society is being constructed, a democratic judiciary and humane conditions in prisons are a highly sensitive area.
Ukraine and Russia have an action plan in this field through TACIS.
Georgia does not.
This is why it is important that Georgia also has an action programme for democracy, in cooperation with the Council of Europe, through the TACIS programme.
I am pleased that Mr von Habsburg supports our amendments provided that the first amendment takes the form of an addition.
We would then make an oral amendment to the second amendment.
