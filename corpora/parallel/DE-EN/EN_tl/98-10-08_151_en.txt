Mr President, Levi Strauss intends to close various factories in Belgium and France and to cut 1 461 jobs.
The group was not making a loss; on the contrary, it made a profit last year of several hundred million Belgian francs.
It is the company's relocation policy.
A new factory has been opened in Turkey, and the factory in Hungary has even doubled its output.
We disapprove of the strategy of the group's management, which has announced that it is restructuring because of overproduction while increasing production in low-wage countries.
There has also been talk of a hearing for the employees.
This hearing, or this promise of a hearing, is a joke; if restructuring is ready to go ahead, any hearing has to be a sham.
We declare our solidarity with the employees, and for this reason our first demand is that the project be stopped.
Secondly, we call upon the Commission to request that companies that have received subsidies from the European Union budget or the Member States' budgets should refund what they have received in the past five years if these companies have undertaken mass redundancies despite having made a profit.
Thirdly, we call upon the Belgian Government to finally introduce implementing regulations for mass redundancies so that sanctions can be imposed in the case of closures and redundancies which are not carried out correctly.
I consider these measures to be necessary in the interests of the employees and in order to solve the problem of unemployment in the European Union.
