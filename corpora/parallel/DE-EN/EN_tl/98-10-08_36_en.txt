Mr President, the decision concerning the future use of energy in Europe is one of the most crucial questions facing the European Union.
I have a feeling that the Commission has not yet fully recognised the significance of the energy issue.
Certainly some praiseworthy efforts can be seen, such as the announcement that the White Paper on renewable energies is to be implemented.
But the ALTENER II programme, which has almost no funds, is insufficient to achieve a change in energy policy.
There are five reasons why we need to change our energy policy.
The environmental reasons are clear.
Then there is also job creation, the protection of resources and the export market which we cannot afford to leave to Japan and the United States.
The most important point is that wars are currently being waged for energy resources, and as these energy resources are depleted the number of wars will increase.
Nuclear power is certainly not the solution.
Even in recent weeks we have heard of reactor problems in France, the quintessential nuclear state, where even security of supply was not guaranteed.
Yesterday the dreadful news came from Chernobyl that a worst-case scenario on a larger scale than 1986 is possible.
The changes to the programme proposed in Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz's amendments are therefore vital.
