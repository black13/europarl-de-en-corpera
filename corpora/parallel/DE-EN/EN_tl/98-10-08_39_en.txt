Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for trying to bring together various elements of European energy policy.
I know how difficult that is because energy policy is really a difficult terrain.
I would like to comment further on two points.
The first concerns the way in which we deal with nuclear energy.
The majority of countries in the European Union eschew nuclear energy, and some countries which formerly used it are currently preparing to abandon it.
Even one of the larger Member States is now taking significant steps to begin this process.
However, in a programme to which all countries make a financial contribution, the money cannot only be used to carry out research and work on the safety of nuclear energy.
I think we must also provide significant support for the efforts made by countries no longer using nuclear energy to move away from this type of energy completely.
It is not acceptable that all countries should pay so that a few can use nuclear energy; instead, we must lay further emphasis on moving away from this.
The second point is that the budget only pays lip service to energy policy in Europe.
It does not allow us to bring about a change of direction in energy policy.
We need legislative proposals to supplement this programme, firstly on energy taxes, and secondly on the promotion of renewable energies through a pan-European electricity supply directive.
For this reason, Commissioner, I urgently request once again, particularly in view of the change in government in Germany, that you devote your efforts to advancing the proposal for a European energy tax, so that a proposal for a pan-European electricity supply can be on the table as soon as possible.
