Madam President, I voted in favour of the text but I believe we must improve it considerably, particularly on the issue of quotas, which we must fix in order to ensure that the burden is shared.
The problem is that we spend a lot of time debating these issues but we are actually neglecting the central question.
Therefore, I welcome the much-criticised Austrian strategy paper because it has brought completely new ideas into the discussion, because it is honest and because it makes it clear that we must aim to prevent the causes of refugee problems as well as reducing the burden and ensuring that it is shared equally.
We live today in a Europe in which Bavaria and Austria also border on the Mediterranean and Spain shares a border with eastern Europe.
Only true solidarity can help here and not the Saint Florian principle of hoping that the lightning strikes elsewhere.
