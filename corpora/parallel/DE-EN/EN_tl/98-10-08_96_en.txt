Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, sometimes Members of this House are heard to say that Europe needs to develop a soul.
Well, Europe has a soul, and it is expressed in its universal thinking.
The prerequisite for this has always been love of the unfamiliar, openness, respect for and even curiosity about the unfamiliar.
In Semira Adamu's terrible death we have witnessed the death of Europe's soul.
Xenophobia has become an epidemic in our continent.
Cases such as the death of this woman could happen at any time.
This should come as no surprise in a Union where for years the right of asylum has been systematically undermined.
It should not surprise any of us that attempts can be made to violate the Geneva Convention, that it is possible to introduce deportation, which makes a mockery of human rights.
If we allow this, we will not only be responsible for further deaths, but we will also be killing Europe's soul, and there will be no point in looking for it any more.
