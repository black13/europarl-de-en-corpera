Mr President, I just wanted to add a few words to what Mr Pex said.
It is of the utmost importance that we finally convince the governments that after completing the preparations for the euro we are entering a new phase of European development, in which real priority will be given not just to the economy but also to culture.
This does not seem to be fully understood yet in the higher echelons, hence all these delays, these difficulties that continue to hamper the cultural programmes.
I thank Mr Pex very much for insisting that at least after the millennium we must at last have cultural programmes that preserve the great diversity of European culture.
