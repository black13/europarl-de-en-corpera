Madam President, I would like the Bureau to address the following problem.
We discussed the urgencies yesterday, which included a motion for resolution I tabled on the situation in Georgia.
After the vote I discovered to my surprise that a letter, signed by an official of this Parliament, was sent to various Members - not to me, of course - on official Parliament paper, calling on them not to vote for it.
I would just like to know whether we have now reached the point where our bureaucrats can actually determine Members' voting behaviour.
Would you please investigate this?
