Madam President, Commissioner, although it has all been said, not everyone has spoken yet.
So I shall be very brief.
I want to address four points.
One, pig prices for farmers have fallen more sharply than the prices passed on by the trade.
That too needs pointing out.
Two, the Commissioner said nothing about evaluating the results of the recent pig counts.
After all, he must have good figures here since his expert on pigs learnt his trade on my farm.
That is why he is such a capable man - let us say that quite plainly here!
Three, now would be the best opportunity, and here I agree with Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, to implement the directive on nitrates and to look into the excessive stocks of animals in the Community, so that we can bring them back to a normal level and establish a sensible ratio of fodder land to land spread with liquid manure.
This is the best opportunity to do so.
I am doing so, obviously.
We have all been doing so for ages.
Only the Lower Saxons are, of course, very backward here.
And nevertheless one of them has actually become Chancellor of Germany.
That just goes to show the possibilities in our country!
Four, it needs to be checked to what extent the sharp fall in the grain price has had an impact on or stimulated the processing industry.
The farmers are seeking higher value creation.
That is quite clear, and then we shall never be able to resolve this dilemma.
(Applause)
