Mr President, Commissioner, of course I fully support what Mrs Schierhuber has described to us so excellently.
She also raised a number of points into which I would like to go in more depth.
It is quite plain that agriculture has suffered most from fluctuations in currency values and therefore also had to accept considerable income fluctuations and falls.
But I have been struck by a document published by the German Bundesrat to the effect that the current compensation rules are not fair and cannot adequately protect farmers from the losses to which Mr Wilson has also referred.
This document starts from the assumption that 1 % compensation represents DEM 600 million, and we are working with a fluctuation band of 2.6 %.
So in any country where this 2.6 % fluctuation band is breached, say in Germany, agricultural prices could face losses of 1.5 billion - according to the German Bundesrat.
So, of course, I pricked up my ears and said to myself that I must put that before you here.
I would not like to stand up in front of my people and be asked why nobody said a word.
So I would now ask you and your watchmen: could this happen, and would that not mean that the compensation had to be renegotiated?
