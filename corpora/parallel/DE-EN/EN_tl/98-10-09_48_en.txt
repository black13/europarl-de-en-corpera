Mr President, Commissioner, you put proposals before us for a radical reorganisation of the agrimonetary system in good time, some months ago.
That will indeed be necessary with the introduction of the euro as a single currency and you did not need letters from Members, which were presumably only aimed at the gallery and at currying favour with the farmers, to point this out to you.
Those familiar with the admittedly extremely complex system of agrimonetary compensatory payments knew these payments would no longer be necessary for farmers in the euro zone, as our rapporteur, Mrs Schierhuber, explained very clearly.
However, they may still apply to farmers from what are called the pre-in Member States if their currencies are revalued against the euro.
I think that is crux of the matter.
I want to know why a Member State that deliberately does not join the euro can be eligible for 50 % of any compensatory amounts out of Community funds and why that Member State can even be exempt from contributing its national share of subsidies.
With the introduction of the euro the entire agrimonetary problem could, after all, disappear overnight and we could save far more money.
I would certainly not want farmers in countries that do not want to join the euro to be penalised.
Yet I do not see why those countries' decision not to join should possibly cost the other Member States hundreds of millions.
I believe we should see whether we cannot find a solution in the EU financing framework, because these countries cannot have it both ways.
