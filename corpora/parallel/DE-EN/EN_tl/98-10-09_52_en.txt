Mr President, Commissioner, I have listened very carefully to what you said.
The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which adopted all the amendments unanimously, had not actually intended to change the text, i.e. the Commission proposal, but simply to give it more depth.
In that sense, I would ask you to reconsider this at a suitable opportunity.
