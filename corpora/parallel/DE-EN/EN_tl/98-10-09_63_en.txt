Mr President, Mr Fischler, you said earlier that we could not sell everything on the regional markets.
But what we are discussing now is precisely the opposite of what we discussed before.
Before, we were concerned not with selling quality goods on the world market but surpluses, which we can only get rid of by dumping them at low prices and for little money.
I have nothing against putting quality goods on the world market when it is a matter of competition.
Austrian wine, French wine, Parma ham: the same logic has to be applied on the world market as on the regional market.
What I want to say is that we must aim at quality and not at getting rid of surpluses from what is one of the largest food import areas in the world.
We do not have any surpluses.
But surpluses do exist in all areas where intervention attracts them.
That is why this report is so important.
We must aim at production geared to quality, and then let us certainly produce for the world market, but I beg you, not with state aids but by finding customers and areas on the world markets that actually want to buy these products.
One last thought.
Mr Fischler, of course we also depend on the rest of the market in regard to our quality products.
If the pig market collapses now, it will of course become far more difficult to keep the regional quality market at a certain price level than if the price is generally stable.
That is why the two aspects are not entirely separate and it is in our interests to promote the overall quality of the market.
