Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, congratulations to Mr Mulder on his report.
Quality policy is vital to European agriculture, although we note that the definition of quality still keeps provoking differences of opinion.
Quality production must also be reflected in the price and in farmers' incomes.
Let me point out that in Austria during the BSE crisis the sales of products with recognised quality marks and designations of origin did not fall.
Although we cannot yet have a uniform European quality mark, our aim should be, as stated in paragraph 8 of our resolution, to pursue this road steadily.
The vast majority of European farmers do not live in advantaged areas.
That is why they cannot significantly increase their incomes by increasing their production.
So quality production must be the number one criterion for European agriculture and its distinctive character; it is essential to obtain guarantees to that effect at the next round of WTO negotiations.
