Mr President, I have one more question for Mr Fischler before he leaves.
By adopting paragraph 5, we have now voted that animal products should be included in Regulation 2092/91 on organic production methods and that this should now go ahead.
You know that a joint Commission and Parliament proposal on this subject has long been on the table, yet the Council has still not put it on the agenda.
This gives me another opportunity to call on you and Parliament to exert pressure to at least put it on the agenda of the Austrian Presidency, because I know that organic farming plays a very important role in your country, on which I would like to congratulate you.
