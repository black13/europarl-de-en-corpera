Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, like Mr Vallv√©, the rapporteur, I welcome in principle the definition of guidelines to establish the Commission's priorities.
They are designed to ensure a balance between economic policy, creating and preserving jobs and the other specific Union policies.
These have already been mentioned: competitiveness, support of SMEs, environment and sustainable development, together with innovation and equal opportunities.
The Objective 2 measures remain extremely important to creating and preserving jobs.
I welcome the emerging evidence of the broader continuity of the various new programmes with the previous programming period.
But one point of criticism I must make is that the quality of the programmes still does not always meet expectations, and the findings of the mid-term reviews are not turned to account early enough for planning future assistance.
The principle of additionality and its evaluation still cause problems because the necessary documents are not always forwarded.
We welcome the introduction of conditional clauses for the second payment.
However, the new provisions on assessments need to be made much simpler.
We support the Commission's intention to give the Member States more room for manoeuvre in future by combining national and Community criteria.
We do not really think the rapporteur is justified in his fear that the Member States might abuse this room for manoeuvre.
In my view, the Commission's subsidiarity-based approach is a step in the right direction.
