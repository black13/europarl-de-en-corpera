Mr President, some time ago Mr Jarzembowski put a question to the Commission concerning the appropriateness of the American secret services' practice of tapping telephone conversations held in the European Parliament and the Commission and of intercepting emails.
The Commission confirmed this information at the time.
Mr President, I should now like to ask what measures you have taken to put a stop to such practices.
After all, even nations with which we are on friendly terms, but with which we are in economic competition, should not be able to hear all our conversations and read our emails.
Nor should nations with which we are not on friendly terms, needless to say!
I would therefore like to know what technical measures have been taken in the new buildings in Brussels and Strasbourg.
