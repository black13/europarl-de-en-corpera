Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we also congratulate Mrs Jensen on her report.
It was important for the European Parliament finally to take an initiative, as it seems to me that the Commission buries its head in the sand and merely observes the problems.
What we need is action at European level, particularly as the data are more than alarming.
We constantly hear shocking information, such as that softeners can also find their way into the food chain, as they can be absorbed in fatty foods.
We have heard the alarming news that these endocrine substances are carcinogenic, and we now know that we must finally have a European ban on PVC.
I also think the way in which the Commission is dealing with the data on phthalates in children's toys is scandalous.
Although it has been known since February that there are at least three highly toxic substances, the Commission has failed to take any steps.
Instead, research results have been manipulated or, more precisely, research methods altered so that the Commission does not need to take action.
This is particularly bad because it is an out-and-out violation of the precautionary principle and because, due to neglect, the health of children is being put at risk.
This is why we have gone further than Mrs Jensen's report and requested that these highly toxic phthalates be taken off the market immediately.
There are alternatives to them, so we do not need them at all.
I should like to point out to the House at this point that we will ask for a roll-call vote as it is very important that we now increase pressure on the Commission on this issue.
Furthermore, until we have managed to ban PVC - and for us this is crucial - we call for these substances to have to be labelled, so that the consumer can at least be aware of the dangers and so that we can increase pressure on the industry to begin a genuine search for alternatives.
