Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that Mrs Jensen deserves credit for tackling an important issue and making good proposals to take it forward.
However, dealing with this issue is difficult in that the empirical basis, that is the data, is not just shocking, as Mrs Breyer said, but downright inconsistent and poor.
That is the problem, and it is why research and coordination of research are priority tasks here.
What is most important for the European Union, as Mr Valverde LÃ³pez said, seems to me to be the establishment of appropriate research priorities in the fifth framework programme of research.
As rapporteur for this individual programme I will do my best to promote this, and I hope that the reports we have heard are not correct that the Council has already decided on the individual programmes, even though the framework programme has not yet entered into force.
The Community's Joint Research Centre could serve as a coordination and control centre for this research and could be responsible for creating a European research network.
Moreover, the Commission, if possible in agreement with the OECD, must urgently provide a provisional definition of endocrine-disrupting chemicals in order to make empirical data substantially more comparable.
The Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy has therefore taken great care in drafting its opinion, and I regret that it was adopted only hesitantly by the committee responsible.
I should like to thank Mr Pompidou in particular for reintroducing a number of what I consider to be very good proposals that we had made.
In our opinion it is high time that we coordinated our research efforts.
In this area, actionism is both economically and environmentally counter-productive, so we should take care not to become actionist, but we should at the same time take action.
