Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, chemical substances which make their way into the environment could be a possible cause of endocrine disruptions.
For this reason it is absolutely essential that we test chemicals for their effects on the endocrine system.
Should they prove to be dangerous, it is imperative that they are banned or substituted.
However, it is important that such precautions or countermeasures are based on a scientific risk assessment, yet there is currently no question of having sure scientific proof of damage to endocrine systems by chemicals.
In the amendments which I tabled in the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy and also in the Committee on Women's Rights, I have tried to draw attention to this.
In my opinion, the Commission should develop a research strategy which helps to clear up uncertainties in the area of endocrine disruption.
Measures based solely on suspected causal connections are, of necessity, of dubious effectiveness.
I would ask, therefore, that we keep a cool head despite our concern.
Our motto should be not to resort to actionism but instead to invest our energies in increasing our knowledge.
We can then use this as a basis for specific health protection measures.
We owe it to the responsible citizens of the European Union to proceed in this manner, as we do not want to frighten them but to inform them, and their health protection must be our main priority.
