Madam President, this proposal for a directive relates to Austria and Germany's derogation from the duty-free arrangements.
There has been a legal vacuum here since 1997, because the arrangements were in force until December 1997.
That is why we are rather surprised that the proposal was only forwarded to us in September.
We have hardly had any time to consult on this, and yet we do consider it to be an important matter.
I propose, therefore, that we reject the request for urgent procedure.
We will endeavour to produce a report for the November part-session, but at the latest for the December part-session.
(Parliament rejected the requests for urgent procedure)
