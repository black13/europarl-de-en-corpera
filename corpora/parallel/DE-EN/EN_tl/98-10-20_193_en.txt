Mr President, the present Directive is a further step towards a strategy to combat ozone, one which the European Union desperately needs.
We know that the Union area is permanently covered by a layer of tropospheric ozone.
The slightest incident can cause this layer to become so concentrated that it may endanger health, and even in areas where the air is clean, plants may be damaged to a degree that has serious consequences for agriculture.
A number of Member States have shown that we could have been stricter, which is why it is no surprise that Parliament has once again tabled an amendment that states: 'Member States which have progressed further than the Community in substituting dangerous organic solvents must be permitted to impose more stringent restrictions'.
I think that we will have to continue in this way, and if necessary look again at whether abandoning the use of VOCs cannot be done more quickly, perhaps even before 2007, especially in the paint industry where many alternatives are already available.
Or maybe we could move over to more closed systems in companies so that fewer harmful substances can leak out.
I also think that it is very important to worry not only about the health of the general population, but also to direct our attention to those people working in factories and workshops, and who come into contact with such substances.
We should introduce special programmes for them, to restore their health or to prevent it from being too seriously damaged.
