Mr President, not so long ago, Latin America was regarded as one of the most promising regions for the world economy.
Today the economic and financial crisis in this region has had very serious consequences, and not only for the people there.
The Latin American countries rely heavily on the trend in raw material prices, and it is an established fact that this crisis is seriously disrupting the international financial markets.
We keep rightly declaring that so far the euro zone has reacted in a relatively stable way to the international network of crises.
But we must realise that all the worldwide economic problems are bound to have an impact on the European Union too, unless internationally coordinated measures are taken.
We shall have to tackle the problems at their roots if we wish to resolve them and revive the world economy.
One problem is that the level of real interest rates is at times too high.
We must improve the quality of management systems, supervisory systems and, in particular, financial systems, on an international basis.
