Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, today we are discussing something quite sensational, namely that there is money in the bank and everyone seems to admit that it is in a sense money surplus to requirements.
We know from everyday experience that it is not that easy to get it out of the bank.
And what Mr Christodoulou said is quite true: we must look at the circumstances and not be too hasty.
But we really should accept the arguments Mr Metten put forward here, namely that an economic area which does away with the old concepts of external and internal trade and then, to be realistic, still has a foreign trade dependence of less than 10 %, does not need the same currency reserves as the pre-euro economic area, with its foreign trade share of somewhere around 60 %.
Secondly, the balance of payments is in fact positive, structurally positive, and that is no mere chance.
Consequently, it is important to realise that these two factors together produce a potential quantity of surplus money in the hands of the European system of central banks.
Of course we will not manage to get hold of it by breaking in with a crowbar - that would indeed be silly - but we shall have to liberate it and use it for purposes compatible with the aim of stabilisation in the euro zone, perhaps in the framework of the European Investment Bank.
I believe that is the point we are discussing today.
