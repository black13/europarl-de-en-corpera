Mr President, I congratulate Mr Giansily on his balanced report and agree with him that the extremely high currency reserves may act as a necessary safety net during the transitional period.
A successful speculative attack on the single currency during this phase could in effect have serious implications for the European economy and do considerable damage.
It is clear, however, that surplus currency reserves of up to USD 200 billion must not remain unused in the long term.
In my view, it is therefore quite legitimate to begin considering even at this stage how this money could be used in future to combat the high unemployment rate in Europe.
In any event, it would be unjustifiable to leave it lying around unused any longer than is absolutely necessary.
Everybody knows that neither the Community nor most of the Member States have enough funds for research.
Here the situation is markedly better in the United States and Japan.
With more support for research and innovation, we could manage to make our firms more competitive and thereby give impetus to employment policies.
In particular, this would enable us to strengthen the SMEs - which form the backbone of the EU - in terms of technology and also make them more competitive.
So let me conclude by calling for the surplus currency reserves to be targeted at practical research programmes, when the time comes, so that we can successfully tackle our main problem, namely massive unemployment.
