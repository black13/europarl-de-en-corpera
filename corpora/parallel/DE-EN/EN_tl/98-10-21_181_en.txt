Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as a member of the Committee on Budgets, I am always concerned with speaking out in favour of fair structural conditions.
I would like to come back to what Mrs Maij-Weggen said.
I think that in principle we should from time to time reflect on the worth of certain regulations, and attempt to lay down objective criteria as to where provisions are still relevant and where they could be removed.
Own resources is a sensitive area for us because it consists of amounts of money which are important for the EU.
I think that it is very easy to use forged certificates of origin, because monitoring the flow of goods (which is often independent of financial flows), and dealing with the accompanying papers and the people involved in the operation is so difficult.
Any groups that have specialised in fraud would of course know the weaknesses of our system and also how to hide their cheating by staggering the four flows into a favourable chronological sequence.
I think it is necessary to offer better training in this area.
There has been some progress, but it might be necessary, especially in the field of statistics, to develop increasingly precise methods in order to determine what the likelihood of fraud is in each of the four flows.
I would also like to point out our request that OLAF should, together with the Court of Auditors, undertake intensive monitoring.
There is also of course the issue of jurisdiction, and of who is really laying down the measures that will lead us to fair structural conditions.
