Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the future of Europe presents us with some major questions, to which we must not give trivial answers.
In today's debate we are discussing real issues, and quite rightly not fighting mock battles.
To make the EU fit for the twenty-first century, we must gradually continue the integration process we have begun by also embarking on institutional reforms; that does not mean adhering only to what has been achieved and certainly does not mean renationalisation.
The crux of the debate on subsidiarity lies in the fact that the Maastricht and Amsterdam Treaties have shifted the EU power structure more towards common policies, and that this fact has simply not yet been recognised in national policy-making.
Most European questions have now become internal policy questions that have to be resolved jointly with the EU.
It is important for the governments to say quite openly to their citizens at home: yes, we will and must decide on a common European basis, because that is good for our country and because our country can no longer resolve central issues on its own.
The Euroscepticism we see among some sections of the population stems from a certain attitude: if the sun shines in the morning, it is thanks to our country; but if we wake up to snow and mud, then it is the EU's fault!
Europe must assert itself!
Globalisation and a growing international division of labour can only be established and influenced by a Community with strong instruments at its disposal.
There are many areas in which we must reverse our policies, since we believed too much in deregulation and purely market solutions in the 1980s and 1990s.
The European model still remains a state-based model.
The euro was one milestone, the common employment policy must be another.
I wish the Austrian Presidency great success along this road and warmly salute it: as we say at home in the Ruhr, 'Gl√ºck auf ', good luck!
