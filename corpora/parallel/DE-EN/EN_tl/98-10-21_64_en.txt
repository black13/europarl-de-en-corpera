Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking as rapporteur on inland waterway vessels and wish to make the following statement in this context.
Evidently a change has occurred in the drafting of the press releases issued by the House.
For example, there was no press mention at all of the inland waterway vessels report in the Monday afternoon German-language edition of the press release.
In fact, German-speaking journalists have already protested about this in the House.
I wish to join in this protest and make it known to the public, on behalf of the German-speaking Members.
Clearly the Secretary-General, Mr Priestley, unilaterally decided to change the rules, which is not acceptable.
We in the House decide on press releases!
So I would strongly urge the Bureau to ensure that this is remedied as quickly as possible so that it can never happen again!
