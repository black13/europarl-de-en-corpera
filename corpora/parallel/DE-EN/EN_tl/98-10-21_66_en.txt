Mr President, I wish to endorse what Mr Konrad has just said.
I have had the same experience.
The German press releases cover the budget, rapporteurs and external economic relations.
Here too there is no trace of this report.
I would urge you to ensure that press releases in the German as well as the English and French-language editions are published in full and reflect what the rapporteur actually said.
I consider it an intolerable procedure suddenly just to leave out this press release without a word.
We will not tolerate this!
