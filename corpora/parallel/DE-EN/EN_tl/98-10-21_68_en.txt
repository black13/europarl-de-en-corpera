Mr President, thank you for your statement.
I also want to thank you because you are known to be a Vice-President who tries to ensure that we create transparency, that we work closely with the public, to stop them from looking only at questions such as travel expenses, scandals and so forth.
The journalists must receive prompt information from us, and you as Vice-President have done much to ensure this; the statement you have just made to us is encouraging.
We will be happy to take the opportunity to pass on the personal statement you have just made to the journalists.
I see that as a good and encouraging sign and hope you will continue along precisely these lines.
That is why I am especially glad that you have presided over the debate on this question today, and I believe we had good reason to address you in this regard.
Thank you very much!
