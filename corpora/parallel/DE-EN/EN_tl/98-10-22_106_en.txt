Mr President, we Greens welcome the arrest of Chile's former dictator Augusto Pinochet in London.
There is certainly every reason to consider the bloody deeds of the Pinochet regime as crimes against humanity which could be punished by any court in the world.
However, the divisions that are re-emerging in Chile also reveal how great the influence of this terrible dictator and his henchmen still is.
This makes it all the more urgent that we as Members of the European Parliament support the forces of democracy in Chile so that they can examine the consequences of the Pinochet dictatorship.
This also represents a major success for the human rights groups in Chile.
How must it offend the Chilean people's sense of justice, and especially that of the victims' families, to see the former dictator Pinochet sitting as a life senator in Parliament and being able to travel the world while his victims cannot be brought back to life.
There is still much to be done here.
This arrest also effectively means that many henchmen and generals who are and have been involved in butchery and dictatorships cannot sleep peacefully any longer, because they are now actually liable to arrest.
There is, of course, the International Criminal Court in Rome, which would also be a key institution in the prosecution of Pinochet for these crimes, even if he cannot be extradited to Spain and convicted there, although we very much hope that he can.
We also need to ask why dictators always have to die in bed at home in their villas.
Another point is perhaps quite important too: I believe that conviction and justice are also possible before death!
