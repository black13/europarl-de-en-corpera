Madam President, together with Mr Dupuis and others, I signed a number of amendments calling for action to be taken against numerous other dictators and ex-dictators.
I cannot find any of these amendments in our documentation, and now I hear that the administration has declared them inadmissible, as it were.
Let me ask you this: since when has the administration had the power to decide which dictators and ex-dictators we may and may not pursue?
