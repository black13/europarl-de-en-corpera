That was recital G. We asked for a separate vote on each part.
May I question Mr Chichester on one point?
It may be that something has been mistranslated here, but the German version says that the radioactive waste which is currently produced is principally medical waste.
That, of course, is entirely wrong from a factual and a technical point of view.
If it has been mistranslated, fair enough, but if not, we shall naturally have to delete the reference to 'principally medical waste', because that is not true; it is nonsense, as everyone knows!
