Madam President, I wanted to inform you that 100 francs have disappeared from my petty cash.
That is the second time this has happened.
Would you please ask the parliamentary security service to take action to prevent these thefts, of which an average of 10 to 15 occur here every month.
Thank you, Madam President.
