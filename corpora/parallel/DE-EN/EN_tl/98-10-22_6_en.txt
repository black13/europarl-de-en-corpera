Madam President, I have a question which we should like the Bureau to answer as soon as possible.
There has always been a regular press digest produced by Parliament.
The German version, entitled 'Plenum aktuell ', has recently been radically shortened, a situation which still obtains.
I have not checked the other versions.
In the item on the Spaak report, for example, apart from the Commissioner and the rapporteur, nobody else is mentioned at all.
I should like an explanation for this.
Is it only the German version which is affected, or is this part of a general savings drive?
Precisely because this digest is designed to give the public a picture of our work, I believe that such measures are totally unjustifiable.
