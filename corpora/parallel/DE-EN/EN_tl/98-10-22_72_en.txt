Madam President, I did not vote for the agricultural chapters of the budget.
Not because I do not wish there to be an agricultural budget: indeed, I consider this to be a very good budget, with the exception of those funds which are to be spent on supporting certain activities that not only I but also an ever-increasing number of citizens of the European Union reject, fail to understand and simply no longer want.
We are using the 1999 budget to go on financing the Herod premium and subsidising the transport of live animals.
I am entirely on the side of Europe's farmers, who have to work very hard to earn their living in the service of our citizens.
Let not a single ECU be taken from the farmers!
But do let us seek ways and means of paying our dues to the farming community without financing the transport of livestock to the Middle East and the Herod premium.
My intention in casting this vote was to speak for those people who would not otherwise have a voice in this Chamber.
