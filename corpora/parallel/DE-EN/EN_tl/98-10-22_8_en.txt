Madam President, I should like to endorse the previous speaker's comments on the reporting in yesterday's 'Plenum aktuell '.
In connection with the crisis in the finance markets of Latin America, Commissioner Bangemann was scarcely mentioned and nobody else featured at all.
If this is to be standard practice from now on, we might as well discontinue the publication, because it no longer serves any useful purpose in its present form.
For one thing, it does not communicate Members' views to the public as I would expect it to do.
