Mr President, in some respects, what we are dealing with here is a moral rule of procedure.
I would like to give the example of a case on which I do not think a decision has been made by the European Court of Justice, and where payment has been delayed by about a year now.
Voluntary workers wanted to build a school for homeless children in Chile.
They obtained a legally binding commitment but they have been waiting for the money for a year now.
Luckily they were able to get some interim financing.
All this is surely bad enough in itself, but what is even worse, and a sign furthermore of the arrogance and slowness in the Commission, is that all the letters asking for an explanation have either remained unanswered or have been answered without giving any answers.
I would ask you, Commissioner, to pass this matter on to the competent services, otherwise I shall report it to the European Ombudsman.
This is no way to treat European citizens!
