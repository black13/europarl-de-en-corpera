Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my job as a pharmacist means that I often come in contact with the question of homeopathy.
As you know, patients - in other words the consumers - are reacting more and more positively to these medicinal products in Europe.
It is up to us in this House to accompany and support this trend by preparing adequate legislation.
Mr Chanterie has indicated the most important aspects in his report, for which I am very grateful.
In my view, mutual recognition of registrations and authorisations in the Member States of the European Union is important, as is extending the forms of use to parenteral administration, while adhering to the stringent conditions governing quality and safety tests for the consumer which are already in force now.
We have scientific studies and decades of experience of the harmlessness of these products.
This brings me to the next important point, which also played a central part in the opinion drawn up by our Committee on Research, namely research.
Surely we cannot keep bringing up the argument we have just heard about the lack of a scientific basis while at the same time excluding homeopathy de facto from EU-supported projects.
We already have a considerable number of scientific reports on the subject, and we should further develop and support these initiatives.
We must ensure that homeopathy is given an equal place in future in the fifth framework research programme.
Let me say in conclusion that I have learned from numerous conversations with colleagues in the veterinary field that it is essential to organic farming that we no longer exclude homeopathic medicinal products for food-producing animals from the simplified registration procedure.
