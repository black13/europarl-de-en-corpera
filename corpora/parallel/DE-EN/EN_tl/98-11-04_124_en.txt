Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I will readily admit that I am not one of the fans of this report but, Mrs Roth-Behrendt, you are an intelligent woman!
I am just trying to imagine what would happen if we included game.
Everyone knows that you can become very ill from eating certain meals.
You can become ill from eating game.
That sets off a train of thought: where was the pheasant bought?
Who shot it?
In what area did it live, or did it in fact fly through various different areas?
Or maybe it flew across border areas?
I live in a hunting family near the Dutch border.
I wonder whether this pheasant might have eaten defective seeds, or perhaps even genetically modified maize?
In what field?
On which farmer's land?
Or perhaps the animal feed was defective?
I am just posing one or two questions of this kind, Mrs Roth-Behrendt.
The issue is a very serious one, but I believe we must at least try to explain the feasibility of what we are setting in motion here.
I also have a few questions about the period for lodging claims.
This is a very serious matter, but when you say that ten years is not enough, I as a layman simply have to ask the lawyers: will that mean in future that the person who inherits a farm will somehow or other also have to take over the product liability of the person who left it to him, such as his father, or what does it mean?
I just think that the Commission has presented us with a proposal which is not completely thought through and still needs a good deal more work.
I have learned by now that we cannot restrict the Commission's right to propose, but what we can do is to call for a revised and better Commission proposal than the one we have before us here today.
I think that when we reach that point, it is most important to us, in terms of agriculture, that we also include more of the earlier stages, the seed distributors, the genetically modified products and so forth.
