Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as a representative of agriculture, let me point out how important it is to have sensible rules for farmers on defective products.
It is in the interest of both consumers and agriculture to require sound and high-quality products.
As regards the farmers' liability for defective products, however, we must ensure at all costs that the producers of agricultural inputs - for example seeds, plant-protection and fertilising agents, as well as animal feed pursuant to Directive 85/374/EEC - can be held liable.
Farmers, as the producers of primary products, must under no circumstances be held responsible for defects in inputs, since they have no influence on them.
That is why it is most important to establish specifically that the term 'producer' means not only the manufacturer of the finished product, but also the producer of a raw material or component part of a product.
Here it must always be remembered that seeds, including the genetic material used to produce the seed, are the raw materials of agricultural and forestry products.
Furthermore, fertilising and plant-protection agents and animal feed used in the production of agricultural and forestry products must also count as raw materials.
From the point of view of agriculture, these are essential conditions for liability rules which affect farmers, and they are in the interests of both farmers and consumers.
