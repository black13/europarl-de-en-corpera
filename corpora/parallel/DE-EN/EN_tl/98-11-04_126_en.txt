Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as a member of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights I fully endorse Mr Casini's views and would point out that this position was decided almost unanimously, regardless of group.
Moreover, I would point out that Parliament has often and on the most diverse occasions called for better legislation and stipulated as a basic requirement that in the context of legislation we urgently need to hear the economic circles involved and then also to evaluate the impact on costs.
It is not acceptable for Parliament simply to ignore these requirements.
I do not want to go into the substance of Mrs RothBehrendt's amendments.
It may well be that it is useful to change the ceilings on liability, for some areas at least.
It may well be that it is useful to change the deadlines for lodging claims, or even to alter the burden of proof.
I do not wish to go into any of that today; what I consider both urgent and essential is that we at least observe the requirements which we impose on the Commission, which has the right of initiative, when we put forward our own amendments.
I think we would be disqualifying ourselves as Members if we disregarded those requirements.
The argument that keeps being put forward, namely that the kind of rules Mrs Roth-Behrendt has in mind would offer the consumer more protection, is not good enough.
If we want more protection for the consumer, then to be quite safe, we should immediately say that we must not eat any more meat or produce any more meat.
But that would certainly be a disproportionate reaction.
I think we really must argue rather more pragmatically and less emotionally here, which would serve our purpose better.
We shall have an opportunity to discuss the matter more pragmatically when the Commission has, as announced, revised its proposal for a directive, so that all these arguments can be reviewed.
That will be the right time to do so.
