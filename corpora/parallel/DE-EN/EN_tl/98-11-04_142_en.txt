Mr President, if I could begin again, I would start with culture.
This statement by the great European political figure Jean Monnet clearly illustrates the importance of culture in the European integration process.
The European Union is not just an economic community, but a community of values incorporating a wide range of languages and cultures.
Europe must be made into something that people can experience and understand, which is why I welcome the proposals in this excellent report for getting people involved in cultural activities.
Due recognition is also given to the employment aspects of culture at European level.
The requirement is that three Member States must be involved if cultural events or projects to be carried out by partnerships or networks are to receive funding.
However, it must be ensured here that the Commission provides the necessary infrastructure so that finding partners does not become an insuperable barrier.
Applicants would find things a good deal easier if more help was provided on the Internet or through data banks, and if there was greater transparency and more information on the programmes.
The Commission's proposal of ECU 167 million per year will certainly not be enough to put these proposals into practice, but if we look at the amounts being spent on other programmes, the European Parliament's demands for ECU 250 million per year will probably also be too little.
The report rightly calls for consultation with cultural operators about the implementation of the programme, and we should encourage the establishment of European cultural centres in the Member States to ensure constant contact with the various aid institutes.
This would be another important step in the development of a comprehensive European cultural policy.
