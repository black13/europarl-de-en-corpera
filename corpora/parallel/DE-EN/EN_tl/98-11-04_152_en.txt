Mr President, I think there is a fundamental problem here.
I know Mr Skinner and Mr Ettl to be very clever and astute men, but I do not think they have thought this process through.
The right to industrial dispute is an attempt to put such disputes on a legal footing, and it only works where there are guaranteed rights for both sides - not just individual freedoms or rights of ownership, but also rights against arbitrary lockouts and against the criminal prosecution of strikers.
None of this has been taken into account here at all.
Mr Skinner has very subtly drawn the teeth of the original Commission proposal, I have to admit, and Mr Ettl has added a few points which make it clear that this is the wrong direction to take, but nevertheless the original idea is still completely wide of the mark.
A civilised European right to industrial dispute will not be achieved in this indirect manner; instead we need to sit down and talk about what the guarantees and limits of a European right to strike might be.
This is the only way to tackle the problem, and we are therefore still not happy with the result.
It may be that there is no alternative, but it is still the wrong approach, and Mr Skinner can do nothing to change that.
