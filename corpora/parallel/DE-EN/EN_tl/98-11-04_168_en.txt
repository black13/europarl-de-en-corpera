Mr President, the basic message in this report is entirely welcome.
The Structural Funds are now going to have to focus on SMEs much more in future.
However, I would point out that both the Commission's coordination report and the present report clearly show once again just how far the obsession with subsidies dominates our economic thinking.
It is now high time that the emphasis was shifted onto entrepreneurial independence, and we MEPs could play a highly constructive role here.
For example, we should keep mentioning the EEIG, the European Economic Interest Grouping, in our talks with SMEs.
This extremely useful opportunity for entirely unbureaucratic and flexible cross-border cooperation has not yet been exploited as it should be.
Yet the form of cooperation involved not only brings business advantages, but is also very much in keeping with the spirit of the single market.
In conclusion, I agree with the rapporteur's request to the Austrian Presidency to organise a seminar for the social partners and SMEs on improving social dialogue in Europe.
