Mr President, we know that good vocational training is a factor in preventing unemployment.
It does not create jobs as such, but it is vitally important in the current situation of mass unemployment among young people in particular.
European programmes are no substitute for Member States attending to their domestic responsibilities.
What they do is to exploit the genuine added value of the European dimension in the Luxembourg process which forms part of Europe's employment policy, in progress towards a knowledge-based society that can learn from cooperation precisely because of Europe's diversity, and in opening up a Europe-wide wealth of experience.
We need to make the programmes less bureaucratic.
We do not need to renationalise them.
Our aim must be to spend 1 % of the budget of the European Union on vocational training proper, because this is investing in the future rather than spending on consumption.
The Green Group has tabled some amendments to Mrs Waddington's very fine report, on the issues of second courses of training, accompanying research and opening up the programme to the third sector.
There is one further comment that I feel I have to make, however, before I finish.
There is a shadow over these excellent programmes that we are discussing today, Mrs Cresson.
Please, put your house in order so that your successor can really push ahead with implementing the improved Leonardo programme, and I support Mrs Waddington's appeals to Mr Santer to do everything he can to help you in this.
