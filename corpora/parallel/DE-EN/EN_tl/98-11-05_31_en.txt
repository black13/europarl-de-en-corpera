Mr President, I should like to put a comment to the Commissioner.
The best way to enable young people to find employment is to ensure that they are qualified for the right jobs.
We now know that the majority of young people, 80 %, obtain qualifications for only 11 types of work, which drastically reduces their chances of finding a first job.
This is why I would suggest that transnational analyses should be carried out to identify what types of work are in demand in the medium and long terms.
This is an idea worth supporting, because this is what makes young people decide on what skills to learn.
Would you consider pushing this analysis through, so that young people can finally concentrate on obtaining qualifications in types of work where there are actually jobs to be had?
