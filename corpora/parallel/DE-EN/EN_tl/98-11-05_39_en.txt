Mr President, SMEs are the backbone of the European economy, some apprentices are future specialised workers and others are future entrepreneurs, provided that their training is practical and in line with economic requirements.
The basic idea of allowing them to develop skills in other European countries too is to be welcomed, but I fear that it will prove very difficult to put this into practice in vocational training.
There will be occupations for which it is entirely logical to obtain experience from other countries, such as chefs and waiters, for example.
The added value of their experience ultimately benefits the firms to which they return, and this acts as an incentive for their bosses or those training them.
But there will also be vocational fields where this is not so true, such as with business apprentices learning accountancy and wage clerking.
How are they supposed to gain these skills abroad?
If we really want to bring the European project alive, we need to ensure that periods of training are comparable, otherwise only certain dual training sectors will be accepted.
