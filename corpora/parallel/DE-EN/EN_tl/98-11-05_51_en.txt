I do not understand this, because we did not complain about this report being put on the agenda again at such short notice, although it is a point worth making again.
There was a special new deadline for amendments, which we met, as far as I am aware, when we retabled some amendments from committee.
I think it is quite unfair to tell us it cannot be done and that we have not acted correctly, and I would like to register a formal protest at the way in which this already difficult matter is being steamrollered through.
