Mr President, I would like to support what the rapporteur has said, because as committee chairman I have only just received Mr Garc√≠a-Margallo's oral amendment.
There are many directives on the free movement of workers in the European Union - we cannot talk about one directive, there are a great many of them on the subject.
I think we should not take such decisions on the basis of oral amendments, so I tend to agree.
Mr Skinner has already said that he will not accept an oral amendment on this question, which I think is sensible, and so the matter is settled.
