Mr President, would you please have it recorded in the Minutes that today I found my office ransacked and full of broken glasses and a radio missing, even though I had locked the office doors after the last part-session and, interestingly enough, found them locked again today.
Would you please also record the question I am now putting to you in the Minutes: when will we finally be able to get on with our work without fear of the kind of violent attacks that occurred in Brussels or break-ins into our offices?
