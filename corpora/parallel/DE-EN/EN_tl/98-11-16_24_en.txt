Mr President, I just wanted to make a point of order.
I have heard that Question Time to the Council is to be deleted this week.
I regard this both as an infringement of Rule 41(1) of the Rules of Procedure and as an infringement of the Treaty, which specifically guarantees us the right to put questions.
The right to put questions is one of the most important, individual parliamentary rights and I believe no Conference of Presidents, not even in this House, can simply cancel that right; we have a right to a monthly Question Time to the Council.
I and many other colleagues have tabled important questions to the Council within the deadline.
Let me insist that we have this Question Time.
If the Council wants to make statements, which are often merely upgraded press conferences, that is fine by me, but not in the place of Question Time, which is a key right of every Member of Parliament.
