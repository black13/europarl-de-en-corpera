Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office, I share your concern about the problems raised in the Schmid report.
There can be no question that we need a coordinated approach at European level here.
Some time ago I put a question to the Commission on protecting the euro from counterfeiting, but only received a rather evasive answer.
The fact that the rapporteur believes that the euro will act as a magnet for criminal activity and that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs also believes that the euro will be an extremely attractive target for counterfeiting confirms me in my view.
The overall package of proposals to protect the euro from counterfeiting and fraud does, however, seem to be a useful instrument for tackling these problems.
Here I wish to highlight the new regulatory system for harmonising criminal law, which I regard as very useful.
I see the idea of laying down the framework, determining the crucial features, but leaving it to the Member States to formulate them in terms of their own criminal law systems, as a step forward in the right direction.
Past attempts to formulate case materials on a Europe-wide basis, as in the corpus juris , gave rise to a great many problems and conflicts between systems.
I believe that the legislative method which has now been proposed for approximating the Member States' different, historically based legal systems is a better one, and we approve it, as we do all the other points made in the report.
