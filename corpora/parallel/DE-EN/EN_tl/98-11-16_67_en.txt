Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we know from a reliable source that about 30 % of all crime is now organised crime.
Given that the business of organised crime now extends from credit-card fraud to traffic in human beings and to money laundering, there is obviously an absolute need for action not just in the Member States but also by the European Community.
We must give absolute priority to combating organised crime, as both the rapporteurs say.
What we need, without any doubt, is a combination of repressive and preventive measures.
Let me just take up three points which I see as especially important in terms of combating crime.
The first is that we, the European Community, must finally transpose the measures and the action plan which the Community has adopted.
We must set aside national animosities in the interests of Europe-wide cooperation in combating crime and make efficient use of the instruments we have at our disposal, such as Europol and UCLAF.
The second point concerns expanding judicial cooperation.
We are still at the beginning here: we have proposed some useful steps forward, but what we need to do is to harmonise criminal provisions relating to new types of offences, such as credit-card fraud, money laundering, environmental crime and gangs.
The third point, which I think needs very special emphasis, is that we must export security to the applicant Central and Eastern European countries that are seeking to join the European Union.
We should help them to implement these programmes in the interest of Europe and in their own interest.
The fight against organised crime must be intensified and expanded.
That is what our citizens expect of the European Union, and it is absolutely vital to the security of the European Union as a whole.
