Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, like Mr Liese, I too wish to emphasise once again that despite the undoubted success in curing illnesses by the use of medicines, there are still at present some 20 000 diseases that we cannot treat with much hope of success.
That is why new, effective and safe medicines will still be essential in the future.
Clinical trials, in other words studies of the potential effects of a medicine on human beings, are extremely important to medical research and development.
Various speakers have referred to the need for international networking.
We consider it urgently necessary not just to take joint action on a Europe-wide basis, but to have international agreements.
That is why Mr Valverde and I have tabled three amendments, to emphasise that point again.
This is all the more important because - as has already been said - all these safety requirements also concern the protection of human beings, and in particular the protection of people who are incapable or less capable of giving their informed consent.
Our group aims to ensure that human beings are comprehensively protected in the conduct of clinical trials, that all patients have access to therapeutic progress, but also that we have and maintain reliable and innovative framework conditions for research and for the development and production of innovative medicines.
Mr Amadeo has done some valuable work towards achieving these aims, and we can basically support his report.
