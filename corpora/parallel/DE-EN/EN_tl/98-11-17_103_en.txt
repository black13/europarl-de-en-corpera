Mr President, on behalf of the German delegation in the Group of the European People's Party, but also on behalf of the Austrian and some other delegations - for example, the Luxembourgish delegation - I would like to say that some of us voted against the Cederschiöld report and some abstained from the vote because it is our opinion that this report was rendered unacceptable by the adoption of the socialists' amendment on the introduction of voting rights for foreigners.
The text contravenes our own constitution and the Treaties because we are exceeding our authority here, and it contravenes the constitutions of a number of Member States, such as Germany, that expressly prohibit it; it is a pity that this does such a disservice to the serious concerns expressed by Mrs Cederschiöld in her excellent report.
We therefore felt obliged to vote against this report although we fully agree with the report's concerns.
But we must reject the text of the amendment, which certainly does not belong in the report, as totally unacceptable.
It is our opinion that it is basically unlawful because it is inconsistent with the legal system of the European Union and of a number of Member States.
