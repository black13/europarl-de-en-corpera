Mr President, I congratulate Mr Peter on his report, which is of a very high quality.
If agreements by the European social partners acquire legal force in the European Union in the area of work by making them generally binding through a Council decision, the SMEs will be among those most affected as they employ the majority of workers in Europe.
The report by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs is right to call for increased involvement of the SMEs in shaping the European social dialogue, which is an issue of great concern to the Group of the European People's Party, as is clear from our Amendment No 9.
The social dialogue is necessary at both European and national levels.
It is also successful at company level.
This is illustrated by the success story of the European Works Council and the positive development of the discussion on the European Company.
Or so I am told, Commissioner.
In both cases the remedy has been negotiations by the social partners to establish ways in which the workers can participate.
A conference organised by the Austrian Presidency took place in Vienna last week on the European social model and the social dialogue.
Comparisons were made with other models, for example with the market economy pure and simple, as in the emergent industrial nations of South-East Asia.
But as they have neglected the social dimension many of the Asian tigers have in economic terms become tame, lame domestic cats.
The effective answer to globalisation is the European model, the social market economy based on social partnership and social dialogue.
The Group of the European People's Party will therefore be voting in favour of the Peter report.
