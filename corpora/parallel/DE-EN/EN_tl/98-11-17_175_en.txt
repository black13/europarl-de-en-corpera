Mr President, Commissioner, I would simply like to ask whether you have heard about the statement made by Mr Strauss-Kahn and Mr Lafontaine at the latest German-French summit, which raised the issue of suspending the Stability Pact in a few years.
What is the Commission's opinion on this issue, and what indeed is its view of the independence of the European Central Bank?
Are additional security measures necessary here?
