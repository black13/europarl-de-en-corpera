Mr President, President Friedmann, you know that staffing policy was one of the five points which caused the European Parliament to postpone the discharge for 1996.
I mention this because staffing policy is referred to in almost all of your reports.
One extreme example is the case of ECHO, which involved falsification of contracts.
I say that it is an extreme case, but issues such as mini-budgets, exceeding the limit of the Liikanen facility, which you have just mentioned, and combinations of interests arise again and again, and the same applies to transferring too much authority to external personnel, with all the consequences that follow both in financial and political terms.
In the report on nuclear safety you wrote that such measures even undermine the credibility and authority of the Commission.
It is therefore a very broad area.
However, I believe it is not merely a question of staffing policy, but that it also has financial repercussions.
I therefore have two questions.
Firstly, to allow us to assess the situation, could you summarise for us from all the special reports what your opinion is of the Commission's staffing policy?
Secondly, can we expect a report on this specific issue, or can we call upon you to provide this?
