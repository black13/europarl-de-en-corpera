Mr President, firstly, the problem of late application was due solely to the fact that we have certain deadlines to observe if the Council is to make appropriate decisions, and for this we were simply too late.
But this has nothing to do with employment contracts in the Commission.
You are familiar with the Commission communication 'on a medium-term Community action programme on measures providing a Community-wide support to Member States action relating to violence against children, young persons and women'.
This is a programme that is to run from 2000 to 2004, and it makes sense to accept this proposal for schools too.
You know that part of this communication and of the action programme is raising public awareness.
I agree with you that raising this awareness must begin as early as possible so that the public develop information and attitudes that make them reject violence against women and allow joint measures to be organised.
