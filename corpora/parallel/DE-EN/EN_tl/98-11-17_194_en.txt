Mrs Kestelijn-Sierens, we are aware that this is a very sensitive issue.
This is why we asked the Belgian Government for information, which we received in October.
Please do not expect me to be able to tell you now how long the investigation will take.
However, we are aware that this issue is a source of concern for the people from that area and they are therefore entitled to receive a reply from us as soon as possible to confirm whether environmental regulations have been violated.
