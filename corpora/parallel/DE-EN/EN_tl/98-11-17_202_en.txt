Mr President, Mr Hatzidakis, I do not have any figures from other Member States, but of course you know that for years we have been busy hurrying along improvements to the tendering procedures for public procurement.
And you also know that the reform of public procurement has necessitated legislative changes that must now also be brought through Parliament by a democratic procedure.
Therefore, all of this has lasted much longer than what was acceptable to us as well.
However, we are now well on the way to obtaining really secure data.
It would be good if, together - you given your responsibility as a Member of Parliament, and we given our responsibility as the Commission -, we now waited for the meeting of the monitoring committee where we could assess the last relevant inspection.
