Mr President, I should gladly like to try that.
I have just pointed out that we have now started a very specific inspection, the results of which are to be discussed on 19 November in the monitoring committee.
Please appreciate that I do not wish to prejudge the meeting of the monitoring committee here today.
However, I have made it clear what the consequences are if defects can definitely be proved.
First and foremost, these are not things which the Commission demands from companies, but which the Member State is obliged to demand, because responsibility for the inspection lies with the Member State.
We cannot govern within the Member State, nor do we wish to.
There is not only the principle of subsidiarity, but also the need to separate the powers.
However, it is clear that the necessary consequences will be discussed in the joint committees, and this is the case for both the monitoring committee, in which the Commission is also represented, and for this Joint Committee, which was set up because we realised that the system of pubic procurement is not working adequately.
Due to our discussion in Parliament today, I will also gladly instruct our representative in the monitoring committee not only to be very careful when finding out which problems have actually occurred, but also to make sure that they result in appropriate financial consequences for companies, and naturally consequences under criminal law, where this proves necessary or is indicated.
But I have to know the facts first before I start quoting criminal law here.
In this respect, I now consider this discussion to be a further impetus for the representatives of the Commission to take appropriate action at the meeting of the monitoring committee on 19 November.
