You know that, should there be delays, it is not because of the Commission, and I still hope that we will also manage through a joint effort to bring the discussions on the Structural Funds to a close in May, that is, before you begin the election campaign.
The Commission already submitted its proposals in March this year, and in this respect, more concrete results could have been achieved had they been wanted.
However, it is now up to the Council, and I hope that the Council will ultimately remain loyal to the decisions it made in Cardiff.
As far as Objective 6 is concerned, the principles applying to Finland and Sweden, which were laid down in their treaties of accession, are being retained; the one exception is a region in Finland which is going to be a genuine Objective 1 area, and which will be improved in accordance with this status.
However, as was already said, this is the Commission's proposal, and the Council and Parliament still have to agree to it.
