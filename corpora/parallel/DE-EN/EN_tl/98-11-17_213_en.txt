Commissioner, what you have just summarised in your answer shows that we have already come a very long way particularly on this important matter, and above all, that we have gone in the right direction for the regions, but also particularly for you as the Commissioner responsible.
The question which is always asked in this connection, of course, is the question of how much.
Interreg was previously one of 15 Community initiatives, and funds were therefore not abundant, at least in the previous support period.
How does the situation look for the next support period, as far as you can tell?
