Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my thanks for the presentation of the Court of Auditors report.
I was particularly interested in the chapter on foreign policy.
As you know, in deciding to postpone the discharge for 1996 we paid particular attention to the PHARE, TACIS and MEDA programmes.
I have now read the new Court of Auditors report for 1997, bearing in mind our criticism from 1996, 1995 and also 1994, because I wanted to know whether there is any improvement in how our money is managed in the area of foreign policy.
The new report for 1997 has confirmed my opinion that the Commission obviously still finds it difficult - and I am saying this from a completely neutral point of view - to take action on the problems it discovers in the large PHARE, TACIS and MEDA programmes, action that would enable us to say that things really will be better next year.
I would therefore like to ask the Commission: why should Parliament believe that the assurances that next year will bring an improvement really will come true?
