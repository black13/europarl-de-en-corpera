Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to thank the Commission for taking the initiative to produce this Green Paper.
If we want to ensure that Europe is competitive, we have to work on innovation.
Sponsoring research is one element of a policy supportive of innovation.
At the same time, however, it is of crucial importance to guarantee effective legal protection of industrial property throughout the EU.
In this context, it is also particularly important for all the options for reshaping European patent law to be explored, a process which the Commission has initiated with its Green Paper.
A key point, to which I - speaking on behalf of the Committee on Research - attach particular importance is improving patent protection for computer software.
Pursuant to Article 52(2) of the European Patent Convention and the corresponding national patent laws in the European Union, computer programs are excluded from patent protection.
If we do not want to lose our competitive edge in the field of computer software technology, we need to change this legal situation.
We should, therefore, delete computer programs from the provisions of Article 52(2) of the European Patent Convention.
In addition, the respective national provisions should be harmonised by means of a European directive.
By introducing these new arrangements, we could avoid falling behind the United States and Japan, where there is already extensive patent protection for computer software.
New rules also need to be introduced on the language regime.
The rapporteur's preferred solution here is also the one I have supported in my opinion for the Research Committee.
A translation of the full patent specification would only be required if there were a dispute over the rights created by the patent.
This would mean that the average translation costs could be reduced from their previous DEM 22 500 to DEM 4 000.
Once again, my thanks go to the rapporteur.
