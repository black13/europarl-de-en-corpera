Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are talking about the future, and the future is very important for everyone.
Babies born today will probably live to be 100 years old!
We know that one of our most important objectives for the future is to remain in good health until we reach old age.
That means that, even today, we need to consider how we can maintain the level of social security for the elderly.
Today we have the principle of the contract between generations, with the result that young people provide what the elderly consume, and we need to complement this, in an appropriate way, with the principle of saving.
It is a question of finding a sensible way to bring public pension schemes into line with private and company ones.
If we can produce basic conditions for an internal pensions market in Europe, then we too will be able to look towards the future with hope.
