Mr President, we should be happy that only ECU 300 million were spent of the total ECU 850 million of PHARE and TACIS funds made available for nuclear safety, because 80 % of the money was scandalously spent on safety studies of dubious value, simply on paperwork.
On top of that, it stayed in Western hands without any proper methodology, evaluation or consultation, and without the eastern European countries being informed of the results of the studies.
What this amounts to is simply money down the drain, and we have not even achieved the slightest improvement in safety as a result.
That is the true scandal, and here I would like to hear from the Commission how it intends to put a stop to such situations in future.
Secondly, I would like to give an example of how money is wasted.
For the purpose of a rather dubious investigation a study costing ECU 170 000 was undertaken to preserve the Siberian tiger.
The study was carried out in Italy, filed away and forgotten about, and it was concluded that the tiger would simply die out.
So that was the end of that.
Something else could have been done with this money.
This is how the Commission wastes money on studies which do not lead to any action bring taken.
I would therefore like to know what will be done in the near future with the ECU 550 million that we have left for nuclear safety, and whether we will continue to have studies of dubious value without any action being taken as a result.
