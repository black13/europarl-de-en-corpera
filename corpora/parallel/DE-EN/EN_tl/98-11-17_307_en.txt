Mr President, it seems grotesque that we should have a report before us which purports to be about competitiveness but is actually about an increasingly highly subsidised industry.
Fifty per cent of the aerospace industry is about military production, which is kept alive by public money and public money alone.
The report speaks of efficiency.
Let me tell you that the best way of achieving efficiency and competitiveness would be to combine the restructuring of the aerospace industry with disarmament strategy and not, as is suggested here, to pursue a process of building up and renewing our military arsenals.
The Greens are particularly concerned that, in the absence of safeguards, mergers in the aerospace industry will trigger an irreversible arms spiral in Europe and that this will all happen without transparency and democratic control.
Research and development funds are being misused here.
In view of the changing climate, they would be far better spent on areas such as renewable sources of energy.
