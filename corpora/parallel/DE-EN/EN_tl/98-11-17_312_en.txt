Mr President, allow me to deal with an aspect that was not expressly mentioned in this excellent report, namely the question of component supplies.
The aerospace industry awards contracts to hundreds of small and medium-sized businesses in most Member States of the European Union.
If Airbus sells a large number of aircraft, that means good business for many upstream companies, which safeguards numerous jobs.
For that reason alone, there is never too much we can do for European civil aviation or for the European space industry.
In order to obtain a proper grasp of the economic significance of the aerospace industry, the Commission should produce a study on the volume of component supplies.
That would be an important step.
Above all, the study should include the percentage of total supplies drawn from small and medium-sized businesses and the number of staff employed by the component manufacturers.
It would also be interesting to catalogue the countries of origin of the supplied components, since that would enable us to determine, for example, whether the Airbus really is a pan-European aircraft.
