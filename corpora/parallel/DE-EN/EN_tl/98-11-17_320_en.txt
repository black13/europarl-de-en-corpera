Mr President, I fully endorse the substance of the rapporteur's comments in so far as they referred to the social aspect of the coins.
The Council has shown no signs of a social conscience in this matter.
The introduction of the euro would be a unique opportunity to prove that the European Union is prepared to make a gesture for the benefit of those citizens whom fate has placed at a disadvantage.
Many Member States are still in the Middle Ages anyway in terms of facilities for the disabled, at least by comparison with the United States.
The opportunity to design these coins in such a way that those who are blind or visually impaired can easily identify their value by feeling them has sadly been squandered.
This would have been a means of giving the euro a human dimension, so to speak.
I am in favour of the introduction of a gold 100-euro coin, one reason being, as the rapporteur so eloquently put it in her report, that it would enrich the new currency by lending it an emotional aspect.
