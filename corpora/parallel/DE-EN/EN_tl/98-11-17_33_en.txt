Madam President, I would like to discuss the planning and implementation of actions in the field of external aid.
The scale of Community activities in this area has in recent years increased continuously in both political and financial terms.
Moreover, neither the extent nor the importance of these activities will decrease in the coming years.
Following the ratification of the Amsterdam Treaty, in fact, the opposite is to be expected.
The content of the Court of Auditors' annual report is therefore all the more worrying as it has found considerable shortcomings in all phases of preparation, implementation and assessment of the actions by the Commission.
The cost/benefit outcome currently falls far short of its potential, and it is not clear whether restructuring measures within the Commission, for example the creation of a common service for all external aid and ECHO, can solve all these management problems.
Unfortunately, as we have already seen, while the creation of a separate common service results in improvement of management capacities, it also distances political and economic services from the implementation of policies.
The question I would like to ask the Court of Auditors is the following: is the Court of Auditors of the opinion that the creation of the common service RELEX will result in significant improvements or is it necessary, particularly in view of the future tasks of the Union in this area, to think of completely new solutions?
