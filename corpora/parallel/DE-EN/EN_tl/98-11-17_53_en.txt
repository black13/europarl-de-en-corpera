Mr President, the latest statistics show a fall in unemployment.
On closer study, however, we see that unemployment has fallen to a lesser degree than the economy has grown in the same period.
The fact that 23 million European citizens are living at subsistence level also gives cause for thought, as does the fact that the present report warns of low-pay and low-quality jobs and demands that monetary stability be maintained.
The Luxembourg Summit's guidelines for a successful employment policy are ambitious.
No one will seriously oppose alternatives to taxation on labour or measures to improve the climate for investment or education and training.
But these formulas are not new, after all.
Precisely these measures were discussed at the Essen Summit in the context of the White Paper on employment.
However, it is sobering that the NAPs for employment are so unspecific about these measures.
Many National Action Plans do not fix any concrete aims or financial resources, or else they are inadequate.
What is needed are appropriate indicators, specification of budgetary funds and laying down of priorities and the deadlines for achieving them.
And how are we to evaluate honestly the progress and results of employment policy?
I have to say that I hear the message but I do not believe it if the Member States fail to realise the objectives.
