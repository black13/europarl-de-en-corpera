Mr President, my request is for the different language versions of Amendments Nos 1 and 10 to be brought into line.
In committee we used the German text for the vote, and there I asked that the English version be aligned with it.
Now, however, the original German version of the amendments has also been changed for presentation to the House.
It is very important that we clarify that what we are voting on is what was adopted in committee in the original German version.
The German term in question is 'gesetzlicher Vertreter '.
It must be very clear that for individuals who are incapable of giving their informed consent, approval is given by their legal representative.
If this is not clear in the English translation, the English version can be brought into line by saying 'legally responsible person', but nothing other than 'der gesetzliche Vertreter ' can be written in the German version, as this was used for the vote in committee.
