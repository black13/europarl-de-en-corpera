Mr President, I abstained from the vote on the Amadeo report although I consider the report itself to be a very good one.
I did this to protest against the fact that in particular the Group of the Party of European Socialists rejected Amendment No 36.
The amendment is worded in such a way as to allow a type of disciplinary committee of the professional representation or a committee of the national professional representation to be convened in the event of a breach by the doctor conducting the trial.
I believe that, where a problem arises, it is the right of doctors, who do so much for all of us, to have a professional representative that can be informed, make a case for and stand by the doctors.
I regret this attitude of hostility towards doctors that is shown by the Group of the Party of European Socialists and I wished to protest against this by abstaining from the vote.
