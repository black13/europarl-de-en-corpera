Mr President, 60 seconds of speaking time is not enough for a comprehensive analysis.
So I would like to concentrate on one aspect of the Bar√≥n Crespo report.
The rapporteur would also like to finance agricultural development measures out of PHARE funds.
Only recently, Parliament took some ECU 200 million from the PHARE programme for the 1999 financial year and allocated it to other areas of external relations.
Its reasoning was that the absorption capacity of the Central and Eastern European states was exhausted.
Is it not absurd to decide a few weeks later to give further PHARE support to the tune of ECU 1 560 million?
In the light of the irregularities that have occurred in connection with PHARE, I am against supporting agriculture in the Central and Eastern European countries with funds from that programme while EU farmers have to accept massive losses as a result of Agenda 2000.
