Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, we find it unacceptable for the EU Commission, so far at least, to take it upon itself alone to define the eligible areas for regional and national funding too.
I was pleased to read in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung last week that you are prepared to meet us halfway here.
I would sincerely ask you actually to do so.
Countries like Germany and regions like Bavaria really must continue to be able to determine their own priority support areas in future too.
Amendment No 47 by Mr Schiedermeier calls for just that possibility, which is in our view quite self-evident, namely that we can determine our own priority support areas with our own money.
We cannot have our hands tied and not be able to allocate aid where we consider it necessary to do so, on the basis of our analysis, for the purposes of structural policy.
The Commission must not be able to tie our hands here completely.
We are happy to show solidarity with the structurally weaker areas.
But in return we expect a minimum of solidarity with our problems, given that we are dealing here not with EU funds but with our own support funds.
I know the final decision on this has not yet been taken, but we want to make it clear here and now that we see a link between the reports being considered today and the ones that are still to come.
My CSU colleagues and I regard this aspect as so important that our vote on the Hatzidakis report will depend on whether Amendment No 47 is accepted.
Thank you for your attention, and let me point out that I have used ten seconds less than my speaking time.
