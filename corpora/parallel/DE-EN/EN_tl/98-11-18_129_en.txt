Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a few days ago, official negotiations opened on the accession of six - or, as we keep saying, 5 + 1 - countries to the European Union.
We have completed seven chapters of the acquis screening.
We now know that considerable progress can be made in this area too if we work consistently.
Let us perhaps look back a few years, or even longer.
We see that in those days, Europe was facing problems with dictatorial regimes, that we were at war, and that in founding the European Union we were endeavouring to establish a system of democracy, market economy and security in Europe.
I believe we must always regard these as the central aims.
The Pope did so during the visit to Vienna.
He said that we do not want enlargement of the Union - we are in fact Europe, and we should try constantly to move closer towards the same principles in a common Europe.
I believe a comprehensive concept for the accession strategies is quite simply necessary in order to prepare the applicant countries for the single market and political union.
I myself am vice-chairman of the Slovakia/European Parliament delegation.
It has become particularly evident in the case of Slovakia that our policy has done much to change the system, that its positions are now clear, and that the country is also perfectly adapted to accession.
I believe we should make it quite clear, again and again, that we are not urging accession, but that the door to Europe stands open.
However, it is up to these countries themselves how quickly they can meet the conditions which are plainly set out before them.
