Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as Mrs JÃ¶ns, the rapporteur, has already explained, her report is about the organisation of ESF content.
Important things are to be settled in the framework regulation as it is still unclear whether or not certain points are going to be included in the text of the ESF Regulation.
These delimitation problems should not arise in future.
With regard to organisation, there were at first considerable differences of opinion between my group and the Socialists.
As a result of many constructive discussions and rounds of negotiation continuing through into yesterday afternoon, we managed to reach some compromises.
I should like to express my respect for the rapporteur and thank her for being prepared to enter into discussion with me.
I should particularly like to thank her for the commitment she has shown.
We agree on the basic direction to be taken.
The ESF is the structural policy instrument for fighting unemployment, and this in turn is the best social policy.
Unemployment is the biggest economic problem we have, and the biggest problem for social policy.
ESF resources are in short supply, and we must bear this in mind when considering the compromises that have materialised.
This is the message for the Commission regarding the implementation of the text.
It is also because of this that education is not itself one of the fields of ESF intervention, although of course it is a prerequisite for employability and for a culture of lifelong learning.
Of course Europe should also play its part.
But on the basis of experience garnered from the last few programming periods, we have agreed not to just use the word concentration because it sounds good, but also to implement it rigorously.
This is also true when it comes to the application of the ESF resources, where we want concentration on actively combatting unemployment.
In this process, we should be guided by the employment guidelines at all levels.
