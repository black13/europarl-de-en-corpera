Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to look briefly at the main points.
The ceilings of 1.27 % of the gross national product on the revenue side and 0.46 % on the expenditure side for the Structural Funds should not in future be exceeded.
For Objective 1 the threshold should be a strict 75 %!
Objective 6 regions - peripheral and island areas - are in the Treaty, but that is all.
Phasing out should just be six years, not seven under any circumstances, otherwise you will be dealing with them forever.
With regard to Objective 2, I do not agree with you.
I do not like this catch-all category of yours, as the rural area will probably get a raw deal.
I am afraid that unemployment as a sole criterion may be too harsh and I think that the soft criteria are important so that national authorities can have a say in the arrangements.
For reasons of fairness, I want the 'phasing out' to be not four years but six, as you know is the case with Objective 1.
I would say yes to the safety net.
With Objective 3, I would say yes to the horizontal assistance.
I fully agree with you on the three Community initiatives.
If you permit others, then you will quickly find that you end up with 13 again, and that is also something that I do not want.
No reserves, Commissioner, I cannot grant you that playground.
National assistance is better and I would support it.
Above all else, within the context of subsidiarity it should still be possible for us at least to use own resources without the Commission constantly stepping in.
So please increase the 'de minimis' rule as you have already promised to do.
My preference would be ECU 1 million, as we could easily accept that and arrange everything quite successfully.
Commissioner, although you are already hearing about the red-green majority, I do hope that you accept sensible proposals from the other side.
As I am a trade unionist, I hope that this is at least one level on which we can agree.
