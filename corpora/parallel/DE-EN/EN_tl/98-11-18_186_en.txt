Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first I wish to thank the Council and the Commission for the emergency aid.
It is perhaps not always a matter of course in this House for us to thank one another, but I do want to express my open praise for them here.
I am also glad that Mrs Bonino has made the European Union visible in Central America through her presence there.
I have little time and will therefore be brief.
Unfortunately, this will not be the last natural disaster to occur, so I would advise that we consider building up a kind of disaster aid system.
A number of countries in the world actually have a special ministry for disasters, with its own transport capacity, aircraft and perhaps even satellites for predicting natural disasters.
My second point is that longer-term reconstruction aid should be given not only to the states of this region, but also towards the integration of the region.
Now that so much has been destroyed, infrastructure measures, roads, telecommunications, energy networks and so forth can in fact also help to turn this region, inhabited by something over 30 million people, into a common region.
The European Parliament, with the support of the Council and the Commission, has always expressed strong political support for the integration of this region.
My third comment is that we keep saying the aid must be unbureaucratic.
On the other hand, it must be carefully thought through, planned for the long term and as transparent as possible.
That is squaring the circle, I know.
Perhaps we could discuss one day how we really can square the circle, since otherwise we shall be in trouble with the Court of Auditors again.
