Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the situation in Central America is devastating: 12 000 people are dead, 18 000 missing.
In Honduras, 90 % of the banana harvest has been ruined and 70 % of the roads are destroyed.
A majority of Central American states have seen their development set back by years.
The European Union aid is vital, not least as a means of preventing the threat of an escalation of the political situation in Nicaragua.
The call for resources to be used to maximum effect in the motion for a resolution is of course welcome.
Besides the humanitarian aspects, which we all support in this House and where we strongly encourage the Commission to continue its activities, let me address a further aspect, following on from what Mr Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler said.
Many experts believe that the high level of greenhouse gas emissions is one of the main causes of this environmental disaster.
In these circumstances, I cannot understand why the adoption of rules on reducing greenhouse gases was postponed for another two years at the climate conference in Buenos Aires.
I believe that it is essential, precisely in view of this kind of natural disaster, for the Union to give firm support to a rapid, worldwide reduction of CO2 emissions.
