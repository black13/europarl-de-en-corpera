Madam President, Commissioners, quite an important objective in the Council Regulation is that the ERDF resources should mainly be used for measures which are favourable to employment.
I would consider that point, which was also the subject of our discussion in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, to be particularly significant.
I should like to pick out a few essential points which we in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs unanimously thought should be implemented.
Firstly, we know that, in general, flexible models and new forms of organising work also lead to more jobs.
However, we also know that these flexible models are very often not applied, and this is often because small and medium-sized companies are not in a position to transpose them.
That is why we would request that you promote examples which can show how these new flexible models are to be implemented in smaller companies.
Secondly, many small and medium-sized companies cannot afford to transfer to their companies all the technology that has been developed.
I would propose that we set up innovation centres where innovative young entrepreneurs can obtain the appropriate knowledge and guidance to create new jobs in young companies.
Thirdly, we think that from the very beginning of each project attention should be given to ways of best developing human resources in this context.
Fourthly, we were all very concerned that the needs of the disabled should receive special attention during the planning stage of the infrastructure measures being supported.
There are a great many other points, but I think that these are the main ones that can help to create a higher level of employment.
We have reached unanimous agreement on these points and I call for them to be implemented.
