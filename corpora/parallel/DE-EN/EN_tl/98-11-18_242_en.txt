Madam President, Commissioners, one of the most important aims of this reform is concentration.
If we are to achieve this objective, the funds available must be concentrated on - that is, allocated to - the really needy areas.
The more regions are classified in the highest category of assistance - Objective 1 - either because people do not wish to accept the 75 % threshold or because they find ways to avoid complying with it, the harder it becomes for us to achieve this important Community objective satisfactorily.
That is acceptable neither in the present Community of 15 Member States, nor in the light of the coming enlargement.
In my view the 'phasing out' suggested by the Commission is in itself a fair way of dealing with the regions that have reached the 75 % mark.
But let me give you an example by way of clarification: a region that has reached 74 % in 1999 would evidently remain at the top level of assistance for another six years and then ultimately enter the 'phasing out' stage by 2011.
If I may express it thus: those who have benefited cannot with a clear conscience claim that there is a lack of solidarity in the EU; quite the contrary.
I should like to remind you that we had a very distinguished guest here today, the President of one of the countries on our doorstep.
I hope that if we ever reach the situation where the Republic of Poland fulfils the 75 % criterion during membership - and of course neither I nor any one of us knows when that might be - then our Polish friends will not insist upon staying in the top level of European assistance for more than 12 years from that date.
To summarise, we in Parliament should really think once more about establishing a clear, exact definition of the criterion for membership of Objective 1.
I hope that tomorrow's decision will reflect this.
