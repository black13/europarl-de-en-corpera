Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we say that enlargement of the European Union is the greatest challenge since the cold war.
We say that the accession of our eastern neighbours can bring new stability to Europe.
The Council representative says that our neighbours await European Union support for tackling their reforms and adopting the acquis communautaire .
But let us look at the scale of the financing: it is pocket money and it is shameful.
The reality is that the applicant countries are virtually paying all the costs of the pre-accession strategies themselves.
That is why I regard the patronising attitude towards these candidates reflected in the regulation as unacceptable.
Surely they cannot be treated merely as objects of decision-making.
They must finally be recognised as partners.
The least we should do is to give them a say in the coordinating committee.
The Greens reject the concept of enlargement as a one-way street and call for an enlargement strategy based on partnership.
Let me add something on the amendments, because in my view the order of the voting list is wrong.
Mr Bar√≥n Crespo will surely accept that our Amendment No 17 to his Amendment No 7 and our Amendment No 19 to his Amendment No 9 represent, in both cases, additions rather than alternatives.
