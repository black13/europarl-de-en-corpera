Mr President, on a point of order relating to Rule 41(1), we obviously had a linguistic misunderstanding on Monday.
So I have to raise this matter again.
On Monday, I objected to the deletion of Question Time to the Council from today's agenda.
You said the agenda was adopted as it stood because no group had objected.
But it says in our Rules of Procedure: 'Question Time to the Council and Commission shall be held at each part-session'.
I wish to make that point.
I believe we must observe the Rules of Procedure, even if not a single group has objected to the agenda.
