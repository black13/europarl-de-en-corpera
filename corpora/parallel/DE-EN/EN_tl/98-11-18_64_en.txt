Mr President, this will not become the rule here in Parliament, but in this case the European People's Party entirely agrees with the Social Democrat rapporteur.
We have held a very detailed discussion, which has taken full account of relations between the USA and the European Union.
The report makes some very critical comments about American policy.
If all these critical comments on American behaviour are to find a hearing, the report must be adopted now, and not at a time when there is no chance of our view being heard.
I am therefore against the ideological and hyper-critical attitude of the Greens, and ask for this motion to be rejected.
(Parliament decided against referral back to committee)
