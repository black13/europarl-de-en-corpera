Mr President, I did not wish to interrupt Mr Hager, but simply to say the following.
At three minutes past four, I asked to make a point of order for the following reason.
There are two possibilities: either you begin the topical and urgent debate at 4 p.m. precisely, or you take all the remaining speakers on the Wiebenga report after 4 p.m.
What is unacceptable, however, is for you to give some colleagues the floor after 4 p.m. and postpone others' interventions to this evening.
It has to be one thing or the other!
