Mr President, the suppression of the universities and media in Serbia is, I believe, an encouraging sign, to the extent that it shows that there are forces for freedom there of which, unfortunately, too little is seen at international level.
The Serbian people and Milosevic are still lumped together in accordance with a thesis of collective guilt, something from which other nations have also had to suffer.
I should like to take up what Mrs Pack said.
Precisely because I am German, I should like to emphasise that a distinction has to be drawn between dictators and the people.
We need to support the liberal movements amongst the Serbian people with all our strength and we need to give more thorough consideration to the question: what will become of Serbia?
Of course, that is also closely connected with finding answers to the Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo questions, countries which have a right to develop independently.
There will never be peace and freedom in the region unless Milosevic finally disappears and ends up before the International Court!
