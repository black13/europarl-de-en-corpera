Mr President, we have now debated three motions for resolutions, firstly on Algeria, then on Serbia and now on the International Criminal Court.
For me, it was actually very telling that the word Milosevic occurred in nearly every intervention, regardless of which topic was being addressed.
That should in fact show that we really do lack international criminal law and an institution such as an International Criminal Court.
We have two 'mini criminal courts' dealing with Yugoslavia and Rwanda, but they undoubtedly do not have the scope which a well-funded International Criminal Court would have.
They are not empowered - and would need to be - to intervene in national matters, if they see that these are to do with protecting human rights in a particular context.
Nor are they able to become really involved in a case through a completely independent prosecutor.
I believe that it is necessary for us, as Europeans, to bring our influence to bear on the countries which have not yet signed the Rome agreement.
The United Kingdom and Germany, for example, are among them.
We need their signatures.
We want the Criminal Court to start on time!
