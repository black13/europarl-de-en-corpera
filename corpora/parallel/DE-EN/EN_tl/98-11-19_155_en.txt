Mr President, Commissioner, I met Akin Birdal about two weeks ago in Turkey.
I saw that he is still suffering from the injuries he sustained in the assassination attempt.
I listened to his speech to the human rights conference in Ankara, and responded to it.
It was a very moderate speech.
I would advise the Turkish Government really to make use of the present situation to talk to people like Akin Birdal, who display a balanced, reasonable attitude, and to solve the internal crisis in Turkey, in particular the Kurdish issue.
I believe that Akin Birdal would also wish me to make a few fundamental remarks on the present critical situation.
It has already been stated this morning in the House, by Mrs Green and others, that we reject Turkey's current position on the case of Mr Ocalan and his possible asylum.
I of all people, who make every effort to build up decent relations between the European Union and Turkey - and have been to Turkey three times this year and held talks for that very reason - have to dismiss the Turkish stance.
I should like to urge the Turkish Government once again to seize the opportunity now, so that even if the application for political asylum is accepted, neither side should resort to violence, and that also applies to the PKK and the Kurds' political representatives.
There should be talks, which must not be held with the PKK, but with Akin Birdal, who is also quite prepared to take part in such talks, so that a solution can be reached providing linguistic and cultural autonomy within a unified Turkey.
Akin Birdal and his organisation are fighting for this too.
That is why I my belief is, in Akin Birdal's best interests, that the Turkish Government should take the opportunity to make the best of this crisis and work towards a peaceful internal solution to the Kurdish issue.
