Mr President, Commissioner, we are dealing with a specific case here.
Considered in the light of the Kurdish issue in Turkey, Akin Birdal's sentence actually amounts to a ban from politics.
That effectively blocks the situation.
Secondly, we should not forget that the Turkish Parliament is in the process of amending the Criminal Code and deleting Articles 312 and 159, under the terms of which Akin Birdal was sentenced, and also Article 8 of the anti-terror law.
In this situation, it is necessary firstly from a political point of view for Turkey to take the opportunity for dialogue, to which Akin Birdal has always referred; secondly, from a humanitarian point of view, it is necessary for Akin Birdal - the victim of a shady assassination attempt, as a result of which he is still suffering - to be given access to medical care in Europe too.
It is with this in mind, as friends of Turkey, that we need to call on the Turkish Government to change its position.
