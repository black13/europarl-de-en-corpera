Mr President, I believe that we need to draw a distinction here.
We should not say that Turkey has a particular character, and then put all manner of things down to that.
The demands are actually addressed to Turkey.
The official act, by which the school was closed down, must be withdrawn.
The Turkish Government has to make it clear here that freedom of religion - a fundamental human right - is guaranteed in Turkey.
The Oecumenical Patriarchate demands that this official act be repealed, and here the European Union should make it perfectly clear that this is a basic condition for any further dialogue with Turkey.
It is, after all, the highest seat of learning - if I may put it thus - of the branch of Orthodoxy centred on Constantinople, which does in fact exist throughout the world; given that respect for the rights of minorities has been enshrined in treaties, the way in which it has been treated is unacceptable.
We should bear in mind, however, that behaviour of this kind also violates the laws of Islam, because freedom of religion is also one of the Prophet Mohammed's explicit commands; we should remember this ourselves and remind our counterparts of it.
