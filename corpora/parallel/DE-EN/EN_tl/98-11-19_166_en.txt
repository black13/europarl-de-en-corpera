Mr President, I must present Mr Barros Moura's apologies.
I should nevertheless like to say a few words on behalf of my group.
I believe that the unfortunate events repeated here are unacceptable.
Anti-Semitism is a form of racism which has done so much damage in Europe and further afield that we need to refute all such statements in the strongest possible terms.
In particular, I am disturbed at the failure of the Duma, or the other party members, to respond in an appropriate way.
When a major catastrophe has befallen the Jewish population on this continent, and when there have been various anti-Semitic actions and statements in Eastern Europe and Russia of all places, it is unacceptable for us to tolerate an anti-Semitic statement now.
We must therefore refute this in the strongest possible terms, and call on the representatives in the Russian Parliament to tell their colleagues quite clearly that an anti-Semitic statement must not and never can be tolerated.
