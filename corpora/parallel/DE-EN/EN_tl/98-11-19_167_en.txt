Mr President, if you look at what is happening in Russia at the present time and listen to General Makashov's statements, a cold shiver really does run down your spine, because here it is obvious that the most evil, communist reactionaries of Stalinism are re-emerging, and that anti-Semitic statements are being made in such a way as to cause those in Russia towards whom they are directed to be genuinely afraid.
I should like to remind you of one point: Russia is a country in which there is still a so-called autonomous Jewish area today.
It is the region to which Stalin once sent many Jews.
It is in eastern Siberia, and a small group of these Jews still lives there today, which really feels threatened and fears for its survival.
These Jews are only one representative example of many others in Russia.
We cannot simply remain silent!
In this century, we have already seen terrible acts of the utmost cruelty.
We cannot accept this kind of thing, we cannot witness this kind of thing again!
Commissioner, earlier we also debated the issue of food aid.
Perhaps this matter could be raised in that context!
