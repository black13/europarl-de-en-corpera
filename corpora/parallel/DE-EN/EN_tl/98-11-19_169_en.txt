Mr President, everyone owes it to everyone else to respect their dignity.
That applies equally in economic crises and when times are good.
Anti-Semitism reminds us of our continent's darkest days, and of times when countless people treated these values with contempt.
That is why it is our generation's common task to nip anti-Semitism in the bud.
That is true both of our own countries and our partners.
That is why we are calling on the Duma to be more sensitive and firmly to refute statements which are an affront to the dignity of Jews in Russia.
The fact is that extreme nationalist groups in Russia are being courted by this kind of despicable populism on the part of a few politicians, and that presents a danger to democracy in the country.
Mr van den Broek, we know that the grass-roots organisations in Moscow are the ones which are trying to take action on this.
I ask you now: is it not possible to give the money on the TACIS democracy line which you have not yet spent to these groups, so that you really do spend the money where it is needed, as we discussed on Tuesday?
