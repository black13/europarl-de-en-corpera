Madam President, I asked the Commissioner quite specifically whether he was prepared to do everything in his power to ensure that the money set aside for the Serbian press or other media is also actually paid out quickly.
Otherwise some media would not only have to stop operating because of Milosevic, but also because of the money arriving too late.
Could you please give a brief reply, Commissioner?
