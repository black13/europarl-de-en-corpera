Madam President, what I have to say relates to the forthcoming vote.
The point is that something has once again happened this time which I already complained about months ago: the joint motions for resolutions are indeed available in all the language versions, but the original texts are not.
You know how often joint motions are rejected here, and then the original texts have to be put to the vote.
But then, according to Rule 102(1), that would not be possible, because they are not available in all the languages.
After I complained last time, the situation was rectified.
Today, for the first time, it is once again the case that we do not have the original texts, and I would ask for steps to be taken to ensure that the proper arrangements are made next time!
