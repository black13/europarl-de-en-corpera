Madam President, formally speaking, your conclusion might well be correct, but from a practical point of view, Amendment No 21 constitutes an addition, and I also think that it should be put to the vote, particularly as you said so yourself.
Many Members want participation in another form, within the meaning of our amendment, and I think they are now expecting that amendment.
That is why you have to put it to the vote.
