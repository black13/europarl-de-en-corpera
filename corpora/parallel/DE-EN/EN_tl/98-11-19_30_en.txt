Madam President, following the Commission's unsatisfactory response - that it is not prepared to accept Amendment No 1, on which we have just voted - I should just like to announce that, if the Commission has not changed its mind on Amendment No 1 by January, when we have the proper reading of this document, then we will propose that the report be referred back to the committee.
I should like to make that clear here.
In so doing, we are giving the Commission time to consider whether it might not rethink its position on Amendment No 1 by January.
Before the final vote
(Parliament approved a request from the rapporteur for the matter to be referred back to committee)
