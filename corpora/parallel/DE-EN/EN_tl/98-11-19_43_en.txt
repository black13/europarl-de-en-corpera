Mr President, on the McCarthy report.
We voted against this report for the following reasons.
Firstly, on Objective 2, we think it is inappropriate for unemployment to be the dominant criterion.
It is essential to broaden these criteria, in particular with a view to protecting rural areas.
Secondly, on Objective 1, the criterion put forward by the Commission must not be watered down or extended by the introduction of exceptions.
Thirdly, we particularly emphasise our support for all those measures which will help to ease the pressure of making adjustments on regions bordering the CEECs.
We therefore support the provisions seeking to adapt the Community initiative Interreg, but at the same time point out that this will only be able to make a limited contribution to providing the desired assistance.
