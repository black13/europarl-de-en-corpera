Madam President, I must point out that there is a textual error which distorts the meaning in various documents and in various language versions.
In the report itself, Amendment No 5 relating to Article 3(2) reads accurately as follows: 'shall not exceed three years on aggregate and may be extended for no more than three years following a further decision.'
These three years appear as five years in some versions and other documents.
Extending five years to five years naturally distorts the meaning, as everyone recognises.
We ask for this to be duly corrected.
This error also appears, for instance, in the collection of proposed amendments to Amendment No 5; there it is incorrect.
It is correct under Amendment No 5 in Mr Wiebenga's original.
I should be grateful if this could be taken into account by the appropriate services.
