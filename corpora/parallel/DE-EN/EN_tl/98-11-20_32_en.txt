Mr President, today we are once again discussing suggestions for improvements in the fight against synthetic drugs.
I have repeatedly pointed out why these drugs are particularly dangerous.
The report's proposals, particularly to make the lists more flexible, constitute one step further along a difficult path.
Probably as a result of the very clear opinions formulated in the expert hearing, the debate in committee revealed a rare consensus of opinion, with which I would also identify.
However, this consensus must not be allowed to give a false sense of security or draw attention away from actual developments.
I have followed with great concern the new German Government's intention to start experiments to control the sale of hard drugs in Hamburg and Frankfurt, and to decide on a legal framework for the sale of heroin at national level.
We should really have learnt more from pilot projects that came to nothing.
Drugs constitute a dangerous threat to the health of our children, and liberalisation of these drugs increases this further.
