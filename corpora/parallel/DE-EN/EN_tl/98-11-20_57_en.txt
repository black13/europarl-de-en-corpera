Mr President, the arguments have been on the debating table for a long time.
The issue of whether a report on the issue of fixed book prices has been drawn up yet has almost become a bon mot in legal circles in Vienna.
Many renowned legal firms have given their expert opinions on this issue, approximately half of which were in favour of it and half against, depending on the client's point of view.
This alone probably allows us to draw conclusions as to the complexity of the subject matter.
If we therefore assume that the arguments are more or less equally good on both sides, the problem is reduced to judging the book either as a commercial good or a cultural object.
I do not consider myself in any way to be a champion of the book trade, but a champion of books.
In the battle of competition versus culture I have simply decided in favour of culture on the basis of Article 128(4).
This is because I would like to continue to be given informed advice in the bookshop and not to pick from stacks of books like a fast-food service.
I should like to continue to find quality books in the bookshops and not only paperback best-sellers.
Commissioner, you did not manage to convince me that fixed book prices or their abolition would not change anything.
However, perhaps I read the wrong half of the reports.
If we accept that the development of the Union into an integrated economic power requires cultural diversity and cultural differences, we can only oppose the abolition of fixed book prices, which I would consider to be a declaration of the cultural failure of the Union.
