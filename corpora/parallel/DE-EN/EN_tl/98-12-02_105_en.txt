Mr President, we do not wish to see any torture or executions in Turkey, and we are therefore grateful for the balanced tone and clear goals set out in Mr Swoboda's report.
He opens the door for Turkey to become a member of the European Union and urges that a timetable should be drawn up for democratic reforms there.
He thus spells out in very practical terms the basic requirements for membership of the European Union.
I very much regret that such clear thinking was not possible a year ago in Luxembourg.
This has strengthened forces in Turkey which detect a spirit of the crusades within the Union and want Turkey to change, whereas the forces of democracy have been weakened.
The Member States now have another chance to give a sign in Vienna that will strengthen democracy in Turkey, and I hope they will be guided by Mr Swoboda's report.
I think the ball is now in Turkey's court.
After a report like this it really has to put its cards on the table, and this is why I am very glad that we too have another chance to do so now.
