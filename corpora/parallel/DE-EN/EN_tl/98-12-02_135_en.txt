Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are many things in the European Union that are still far from European.
This even applies to the European Parliament.
The work of its Members is still governed by rules that were devised at a time when this House was merely a parliamentary assembly of MPs from the Member States.
What we are planning now is nothing more or less than the Europeanisation of the pre-European conditions in which our parliamentary work is conducted.
Our debates have shown to all and sundry that this proposal touches on some very raw nerves - on issues of social standards and individual circumstances and indeed on the broadest possible diversity of unique personal dilemmas.
From where can we draw the strength we need for this step on the road to Europe?
The Treaty on European Union tells us.
The European Parliament, it says, shall consist of representatives of the peoples of the States brought together in the Community.
We are not simply representatives of the people, but representatives of the peoples.
Anyone who does not know what that means would be well advised to come along to the Committee on Petitions, where he would see that our mandate is not to represent one people but rather all the peoples of the European Union.
At the same time, however, we do represent a single people in that we represent the people of the Union, which now expects its Members of Parliament to take this step whereby they can establish their credentials as representatives of the peoples.
