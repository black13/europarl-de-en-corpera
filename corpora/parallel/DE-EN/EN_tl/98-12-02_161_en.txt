Mr President, may I say to Mr Langen that I do not believe the old way of thinking will take us very far.
There is now a real need for a new way of thinking.
It is dangerous when Europe and the Europeans like you, Mr Langen, believe we are on one of the Islands of the Blessed here and take a Pharisaic delight in having been spared the effects of the crises.
What is really important is that Europe should use its favourable position to play an active part in ensuring that others can once more set their feet on dry land.
To that end, we need stabilised exchange rates, supervision, transparency, control and ultimately a social and ecological reconstruction of the key international economic institutions.
Mrs Randzio-Plath is absolutely right: we also need a basic political consensus on this matter.
It must be developed within the United Nations, difficult though that may be to achieve and hard as it may be to imagine after 20 years of neo-liberal policies.
But in the world of finance in particular, Mr Langen, the dialectics of power will always apply.
The mighty, through their arrogance, invariably sow the seeds of their own downfall.
