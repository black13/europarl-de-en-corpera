Mr President, what a pity that the honourable Member had to make his maiden speech at midnight before an empty Chamber.
But it is an even greater pity that such an important and excellent report could not have been discussed before now.
I consider it excellent, even though I cannot endorse everything it says.
It would naturally be ludicrous to try to deal in the space of one minute with all the points on which we differ.
I should merely like to say how deeply I regret the fact - and this is not a digression from the subject - that the report does not devote a single word to the problems of child labour and child abuse.
The way in which these two problems have become so serious and so widespread in our time is also a result of the globalisation process.
The Asian crisis has had an enormous impact on these abuses.
Child-sex tourism in particular is thriving as a result of the falling exchange rates.
I believe we can speak of a globalisation of perversion.
The European Union ought to speak out on that aspect of the crisis too.
