Mr President of the Commission, if information policy is so important, then why does your proposal - which we will naturally be examining very carefully - not say anything about how the European Parliament is to be kept informed by the new office that is to be set up?
This is something that struck me immediately.
How can we hope to bring about improvements with the new office if Parliament is to be even less well informed?
My second point is this: the central provisions of your proposal are contained in Article 3 on the office's right of inspection.
But there is a very strange contradiction here.
Article 3(1) on external controls says that the office can itself apply to the Commission to carry out an inspection anywhere in a Member State.
But Article 3(2) is much more interesting ...
(The President cut the speaker off)
