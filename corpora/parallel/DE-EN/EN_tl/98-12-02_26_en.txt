Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, you had two thousand permanent posts still unfilled at the beginning of 1998, so it was not because of the lack of posts that you were not able to keep checks.
Secondly, a Member of the Commission has told me that the UCLAF used Stasi methods, on the lines of East Germany's former security service.
I think that firstly he is not in a position to judge and, secondly, he should not make such statements.
In my view, this proposed OLAF regulation is simply designed to punish UCLAF for the work it has done up to now, which your services have failed to follow up.
This is why I believe you must think we are stupid, because suggesting that OLAF should carry out checks only when instructed to do so by the Commission is tantamount to shelving any controls, at least in your own institution, which you would have us believe is so transparent.
Just how do you intend to ensure that the Commission really is transparent?
