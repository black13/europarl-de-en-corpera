Mr President, I have two questions.
Earlier, when Mr Fabra asked about the future of Europe, you said it was the euro.
Do you really think that the euro represents Europe's future?
Secondly, you said in your speech that we are now going the right way about handling the legal bases issue - which we are not talking about here - and the mini-budgets.
Do you realise that the budgetary authority, in other words the Council and Parliament on the one hand and the Commission on the other, agreed as early as the 1993 budget to abolish the mini-budgets, and that we are therefore not going about things in the right way, but have actually defaulted on this agreement in a totally unacceptable manner?
