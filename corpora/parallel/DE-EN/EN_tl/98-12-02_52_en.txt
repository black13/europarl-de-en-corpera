Mr President, Madam President-in-Office, you have given us a long list of subjects.
No subject of any importance was omitted, in point of fact.
Of course, that makes it difficult to identify the main issues.
I believe it is vitally important that we see a political breakthrough at this Vienna summit on one central issue, namely Agenda 2000.
We must wrap up this matter - which is important to enlargement, but also to the internal cohesion of the Europe of 15 - during these six months leading up to the campaign for the European elections.
I regard this as the decisive issue and hope it will be tackled successfully.
Another matter you did not mention and which really does affect us Members very strongly is the Statute for Members.
It is vital that the Vienna summit should resolve this issue too.
That is partly Parliament's responsibility, but in the end it is also the responsibility of the Council.
It is not just a question of creating a sound working foundation for Members.
However, we are going through a difficult phase.
There have been scandals and accusations.
It is vital that Members can enter the campaign for these democratic elections with a clear conscience, and can discuss European issues rather than having to counter accusations.
I would ask you to take this matter seriously and to ensure on 12 December that the subject is dealt with in a sensible way and can be removed from the agenda before the elections, for our sake, as Parliament will, I hope, propose tomorrow.
