Mr President, given the abundance of important and weighty subjects on the agenda of the Vienna summit - and the President-in-Office has presented us with very much a mixed bag - we can only wish the Austrian Presidency good heart in the discussions and much success.
It will be essential to determine the right steps to take in a few key areas, for example enlargement and Agenda 2000.
In view of the many crucial but unresolved questions in the agricultural and structural fields, I wonder how it will be possible to keep to the timetable.
I am asking this partly because this is after all - and that is what makes it so difficult - a question of interests rather than visions.
So the Austrian Presidency must make sure it engages the right gear and steers in the right direction.
That is a difficult task.
It is pursuing the right course in focusing on employment policy, but this needs to be implemented more efficiently.
There is no shortage of analyses and dossiers.
Here too time is pressing, because there is a long and difficult way to go from taking decisions to achieving practical results, namely more jobs and fewer people without them.
