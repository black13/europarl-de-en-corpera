Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, I should like to thank Commissioner van den Broek for his efficient work in the Commission.
I should also like to congratulate the new government of Slovakia and especially the Slovakian people, who elected their government democratically.
The prospects for Slovakia's accession have begun to change since October, and in its first statement to the European Parliament in Strasbourg, the new government under Prime Minister Dzurinda declared that it wanted to speed up the accession process.
We must now respond to its efforts.
The democratic forces in Slovakia need a clear signal from the European Community confirming that it is on the right path, and the forthcoming summit in Vienna is the right occasion to give this.
It must make it clear that if Slovakia achieves sustained political stability it can join the group of countries which have already started negotiations as soon as possible.
Instead of the Commission producing a final report on Slovakia, the Council should deliver its opinion on Slovakia's application to join as part of an extra Commission report during the first six months of 1999.
The Copenhagen criteria, which have hitherto been a deciding factor in assessing applications to join, should be met as soon as possible.
I think that Slovakia marks a genuine breakthrough in European history!
