Mr President, I think it is very important, as Commissioner van den Broek has stressed once again, that we should regard the accession process as a dynamic process.
The groups must not be seen as closed, and above all the countries must not be divided into different categories.
I would make this point particularly with regard to Romania and Bulgaria.
On the other hand, we agree with the Commission's criticism that there has been a marked decline in Romania's political efforts.
We are concerned at the restrictions on press freedom, and the European Parliament is particularly critical of the criminalisation of and discrimination against homosexuality in Romania.
We call on Romania to take decisive steps to restore the dignity and human rights of these people.
We also call on the Commission to come up with more than just fine words, and to give a clear signal that it wishes to negotiate in partnership.
One such signal would be to review our visa policy towards Romania and to restore partnership and equal treatment.
