Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as chairman of the European Parliament delegation to the EU-Latvia Joint Parliamentary Committee, I should like to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Caccavale, who has given a very detailed account of the most recent developments in Latvia's progress towards joining the European Union.
He has drawn some very necessary conclusions and given clear reasons for them, which is why his report and the motion for a resolution deserve our full support.
The report quite rightly draws attention to the progress which Latvia has made over the last few months and years.
3 October this year was a particularly important, perhaps even historic date, when there were not only parliamentary elections, but the public were also asked to take part in a referendum on proposed changes to the citizenship laws.
The fact that they voted in favour can be seen as proof of Latvia's political maturity, and it should enable the relatively large Russian population to be integrated more successfully than has previously been possible.
Any efforts to increase the number of true citizens and to combat disintegration deserve our support.
The decision to make it easier and simpler to gain Latvian citizenship has clearly been taken with an eye to the future, and is all the more important when one thinks of the country's dark and tragic history, since the ethnic mix of its population is partly the result of decades of occupation.
So the clear majority in favour of relaxing the citizenship laws is not just an expression of political maturity, it is also evidence of human greatness.
It is precisely because the decision taken by the people of Latvia was such a complex one that it deserves recognition.
Latvia deserves our support, and this would also be in our own interest.
