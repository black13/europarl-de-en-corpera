Mr President, the European Union has given the applicant countries a very thorough examination.
Our preliminary findings were recorded in the avis , and the acquis screening is now a further stage in the evaluation of these countries.
I would be glad to see the Central and Eastern European countries turning the tables and delivering an avis to the Union on how well we are doing in making the necessary reforms and preparing the conditions for accession.
I think their report on our efforts would be fairly damning.
It would note our many failings, how we are dragging our feet on institutional reform - which, to tell the truth, we have not even started yet - the never-ending negotiations on agricultural reform, and our inability to react appropriately to new developments such as those in Slovakia.
