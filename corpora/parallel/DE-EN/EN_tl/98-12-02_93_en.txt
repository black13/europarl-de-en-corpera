Mr President, the action and the ambitions of the new Slovakian Government, led by the Christian Democrats, are designed to ensure that Slovakia is included as soon as possible in the group of applicants currently negotiating accession.
Its programme of reforms is designed to strengthen its constitutional institutions and to give fresh impetus to a pluralist society and the economy.
It is now vital to use funding from the PHARE programme to give whatever support is needed for the democratic development of the organs of state and government.
Rapid progress is being made in the creation of democratic structures and there is a clear desire for reform.
What is now needed is to provide rapid and appropriate support for putting these reforms into practice, including the establishment of a statute for minorities.
Our economic support should focus on the setting-up of businesses and providing better opportunities for starting up small and medium-sized firms.
The Slovakian administration is more than prepared to adopt the acquis communautaire as soon as possible, so we should ensure that intensive training and information is provided by our management and administration colleges.
It is now important for the Commission to give the political signal at the Vienna summit that Slovakia is making rapid progress with its political reforms.
It should also confirm Slovakia's positive economic developments in an interim report some time over the next few months, so that Slovakia can be included in the first group of applicant countries next summer.
