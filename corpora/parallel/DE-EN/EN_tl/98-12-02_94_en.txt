Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is a very important debate.
It is important because we are making it clear that the EU is considering not six, but eleven applicant countries with great interest.
One of these is Romania, which is a country I think we need to look at very carefully.
It is true that the pace of reform has slowed, particularly the economic reforms.
It is true that there is more corruption, that the shadow economy has grown once again, that there are delays in the structural economic reforms and that the IMF has blocked loans.
But it is also true that Romania and its people want to join the European Union, and I think that we in the Union should do everything we can to support this process.
We must be determined to provide constructive support for Romania's development, and this involves more than just money.
I think we must make it quite clear that when the applicant countries encounter difficulties, which are only to be expected, these difficulties must not be exploited by those who have never wanted enlargement to be a success and who have always tried to delay it.
I am very confident that Romania will one day become a member of the European Union - there is every likelihood of this happening - and that we in the European Union are only doing what we have always wanted, which is to make the western European Union into a pan-European Union.
