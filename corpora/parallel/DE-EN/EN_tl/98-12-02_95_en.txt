Mr President, I am very pleased that this report supports Slovakia's accession.
Slovakia is a particularly dear neighbour of Austria's and therefore of the European Union, and I hope that it will be allowed to join as soon as possible.
There are two problems, however: Mochovce and Bohunice.
Mochovce is certain to attract our attention, and Bohunice is a permanent source of concern and worry for the public.
I would be against making the closure of Bohunice a condition for accession negotiations to start, but I certainly cannot imagine this House agreeing to the accession of Slovakia while Bohunice is still in operation.
