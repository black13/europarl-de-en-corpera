Mr President, one of the phrases used in this text we are voting on is not clear to me.
I believe the confusion stems from an error in translation.
Once we have adopted this, MEPs will be described as 'Abgeordnete im Europäischen Parlament ', that is to say Members in the European Parliament.
The normal German designation is 'Abgeordnete des Europäischen Parlaments ', which means Members of the European Parliament.
I believe it is a mistake in the translation.
I should like to think that we can continue to call ourselves Members of the European Parliament.
