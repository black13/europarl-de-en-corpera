Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have come to an absolutely decisive point.
May I prevail for a moment upon your patience, Mr President.
At the request of other groups, my group requested a separate vote on the sentence 'Transitional provisions shall be adopted for the duration of the fifth parliamentary term'.
There is a 'no' against this on our voting list, but for the sole reason that the sentence is inappropriate at that point in the text.
That is the one and only reason!
I pointed that out before the vote.
It is a purely technical point.
When we vote, it must surely be possible for us to indicate that the wording we favour does not belong at this particular point but should be elsewhere in the text.
That has to be possible!
This is a motion.
The point is that my group supports a transitional system, as do the other groups.
Just because we have now said that this sentence does not belong at this place in the text but at a different point, you cannot simply rule that the matter has been decided.
(Applause) Since you ought to respect the will of Parliament, I strongly urge you to proceed in strict accordance with the voting list and take a vote now on the principle of a transitional arrangement.
