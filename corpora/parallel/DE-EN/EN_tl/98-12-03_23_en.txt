Mr President, may I try to help out here?
In Article 4, which contains three numbered paragraphs, you will find in paragraph 2 the sentence 'Transitional provisions shall be adopted for the duration of the fifth parliamentary term'.
We voted on that, and the sentence was deleted from Article 4.
However, in the annex to the draft Statute, under heading A - 'Parliamentary allowance for exercise of office' - the text begins with the words 'For the duration of the fifth parliamentary term, the following Articles 1-5 shall apply by way of a transitional arrangement'.
We have not voted on that yet.
This is the proper point at which the principle of the transitional arrangement must be incorporated, as the rapporteur, Mr Rothley, quite rightly indicated.
So all we have done so far is some technical editing of Article 4, and we are only now about to vote on the principle set forth under heading A of the annex, a principle that is therefore still part of the draft Statute.
