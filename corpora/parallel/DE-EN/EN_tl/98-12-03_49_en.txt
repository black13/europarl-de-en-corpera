Mr President, this question was discussed in detail by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights together with Parliament's Legal Service.
There is not the slightest doubt that in this case no absolute majority is required.
The Treaty explicitly lays down that Parliament need only act by a majority of its component members in cases where a specific provision to that effect is contained in the Treaty.
This is not the case, however, in the article to which we are referring.
That sort of majority is not required.
A simple majority, in other words, is sufficient.
That is utterly incontestable, and we did not doubt that for a single moment.
