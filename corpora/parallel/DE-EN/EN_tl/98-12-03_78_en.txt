Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to comment briefly on the fact that Mrs Green has just praised the President.
I do not believe we have any cause to praise either the President or ourselves after three hours of voting.
I think we have delivered a miserable example of the way in which the European Parliament goes about its legislative work: three hours of bartering with amendments across the floor of the House.
That is the quality we are providing.
I find it sad to see what is happening here this morning.
