Madam President, the European Parliament cannot be particularly proud of the Members' Statute we have launched today.
It suffers from a lack of that transparency which we always like to invoke as one of the noblest aims of European legislation.
That is why I voted for it reluctantly.
Mr Rothley's original crystal-clear draft became increasingly muddied on the way into the plenary.
Let me illustrate that with just one example.
The proposed additional allowances for the President and other senior parliamentary officials, which the rapporteur had set out clearly in black and white for all to see, are now invisible beneath the silt.
They are probably hidden somewhere in their trappings of office, which will be difficult, if not impossible, to penetrate.
A similar situation obtains in other areas of the Statute.
If we conduct our politics so secretively, we shall be doing Europe and its people a disservice.
This is a black day for the European Parliament, and I find it regrettable that no vote was taken on Amendment No 18 and that the Group of the European People's Party managed to get its way with Amendment No 27, which sadly perpetuates a 'fortress Europe' mentality, stifling much of the potential inherent in the Treaty.
