Mr President, I think it is particularly important to mention an action implemented this year by the Commission - actually Directorate-General XXIII - which may be very small when seen in an overall context, but which I believe to be very significant and very positive.
Working in cooperation with non-governmental organisations and the travel industry and with a budget of ECU 500 000, targeted and efficient preventive measures against child sex tourism were taken.
These consist of information videos being shown on long-haul flights, information pamphlets being distributed to travellers, and so on.
This is a laudable and tangible first step in the fight against a dreadful development, which is being further exacerbated by the economic and financial crisis in Asia.
European tourists bear a considerable part of the responsibility for this situation.
That is why I call on the Commission to please continue this positive work and further intensify its efforts.
