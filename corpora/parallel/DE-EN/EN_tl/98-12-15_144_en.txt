Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the private economic law of the Union's Member States is increasingly influenced by European legislation.
Recent examples of this are to be found in the fields of product liability, guarantees for consumer goods and payment arrears.
The Union's work in the field of private law thus far has been characterised by a host of individual initiatives.
The Commission should consider whether this method of taking many small independent steps forward really will continue to be the best one in the future.
Of course, the Union's usual procedure is to legislate on individual, limited areas at a time when those rules are necessary, and when they are likely to receive majority support.
An approach of this kind will not necessarily increase our citizens' confidence, however; it must seem to them as if their national private law were being eroded bit by bit, by the back door as it were.
What is lacking is a confidence-building, recognisable system, an approach clearly based on a system.
That is also the reason for the - quite justified - repeated complaints about the lack of consistency when private law is approximated in Europe.
Before taking further isolated initiatives, the Commission should, therefore, develop a plan of action which openly - but also with due moderation - expresses support for some basic principles of a body of Community private law, on which there is likely to be a consensus.
The discussion initiated by the so-called Lando Committee needs to be reopened and included in the work in progress in the Commission; otherwise we cannot expect people to accept European legislation.
