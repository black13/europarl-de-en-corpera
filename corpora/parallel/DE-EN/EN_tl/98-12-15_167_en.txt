Mr President, I should like to thank you, Commissioner, for that detailed reply.
Not only did you give the figures I asked for, you also anticipated a possible supplementary question, namely what the situation is with the current selection procedures and how they will proceed.
Nevertheless, may I put a further supplementary question?
It is as follows.
Admittedly, I cannot expect you to give specific figures, but I would like to have a general idea.
Are there any particular Member States with an especially high number of nationals who have been recruited as officials through this device for particular nationals?
