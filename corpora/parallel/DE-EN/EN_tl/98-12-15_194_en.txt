Mr President, of course most people are glad when there are discounts, and that is what we have here.
We then also have to take a careful look to see whether there is anything more to it than that, for example whether certain shipping companies have come to an arrangement.
Occasionally there might be a cartel.
We have already had cases of this kind, whether related to the tunnel or these sea crossings.
You will certainly also know that, just last week, we decided to fine the ferry companies operating between Bari in Italy and Greece.
We will of course investigate if we receive complaints.
But in this case, there is no sign as yet - as far as I and my services can see - that this is anything more than what would normally be called a policy of offering discounts.
If you have any more information, please let us know, and we will see what we can do.
