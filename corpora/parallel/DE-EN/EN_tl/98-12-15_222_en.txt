Mr President, the physical introduction of the euro really affects all the citizens of the countries that are participating in monetary union.
The replacement of the coins and notes we have been accustomed to with something completely new and different will be an important event in all our lives.
This changeover will require a new way of thinking and a positive attitude to the event.
Mr Arroni's excellent report, which is also technically outstanding, is therefore a highly important document in view of the need to provide economic actors and citizens with information as efficiently as possible.
Large sums of money are being spent on this information campaign, so it is important for the European Parliament to state clearly how the agencies responsible should use it.
As all sections of the population, all social classes, all age groups, including partially sighted people and the mentally handicapped, need to be able to deal with and handle the money, information cannot just take the form of general statements.
Instead, it is important to try to initiate dialogue with the people and to provide information geared towards specific target groups.
We will be able to avoid a lengthy and costly two-track situation in the first half of the year 2002 if people are fully informed before that point.
Institutions and firms that are particularly suited to the role of multipliers must play a key role in information.
These include in particular schools, local authorities, banks or even tourism organisations with an international clientele.
In terms of the acceptance of the new currency, it is important that we should no longer give the impression at this stage that we are advertising the euro, but that we are simply providing information about it.
