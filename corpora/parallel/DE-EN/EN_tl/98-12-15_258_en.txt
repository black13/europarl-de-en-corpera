Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like firstly to congratulate Karla Peijs on her commitment to the fight for simplification in this area.
We should actually apply SLIM rather than simply talking about it, and we should regard the impact statement as a fact.
We must involve those concerned and deal objectively with justified objections.
I myself was a member of the committee of inquiry that dealt with fraud in Community transit, and I know that there are problems in this area, but we must not throw the baby out with the bath-water.
Quite simply, what we need is a simplified procedure.
We need proper regulations concerning guarantees, and we also need the 60-day time limit so that the system is efficient and so that in future customs procedures are handled in such a way that the European Union can see where its money is going.
