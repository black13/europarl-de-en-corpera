Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the 1996 budget year was certainly not a glorious chapter in the history of the European Union.
The BSE crisis was at its height.
It was also a year of scandals.
What can, what must the European Parliament do to force the necessary changes?
In spring of this year, Parliament postponed the discharge and drew up a list of demands.
Some - though not yet all - of these demands have been met.
This may not be enough.
So should we refuse discharge?
Yes, possibly.
But - as today's debate and the debates of recent days have so clearly shown - for many this is obviously not only about a technical process.
Today's rhetoric has shown that Parliament wishes to make its mark by saying that we have to send the Commission packing.
At the time of the BSE crisis, we chose the constructive method of work programmes.
After two years, this has - thank goodness - proved to be the right decision.
Today we have come so far that we are now already in a position to discuss reopening beef markets in the Union.
That is why constructive cooperation is also the option we should choose in the discharge procedure.
In my opinion, paragraph 26 in the Elles motion is actually the decisive one.
It contains the Commission work programme.
As several others have already requested, I would also very much like the Commission to tell us its views on paragraph 26, and when and how it believes it will be able to perform these tasks.
