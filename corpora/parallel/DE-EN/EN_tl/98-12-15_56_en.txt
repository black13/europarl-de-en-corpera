Thank you, Mr President, for also giving me the opportunity to thank Mr Liikanen for his comments.
I should just like to make one point clear: whether we grant the discharge or not, I still hope that the Commission will make these efforts, irrespective of how we vote.
I should also like to point out a discrepancy in the translation of Mr Elles's report.
It is in the English version.
Paragraph 23 has not been changed to reflect the result of the vote and the words 'give/refuse' still appear there.
The 'refuse' and the stroke ought to be deleted.
That is how we voted.
I would ask you to check this in the other language versions too.
