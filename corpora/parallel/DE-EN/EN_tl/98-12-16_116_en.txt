Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, every individual owes it to others to recognise their worth.
This phrase was inscribed by young democratic parties in Brandenburg in their first democratic constitution.
Why?
These words clearly mean that human rights policy is not just to do with moral appeals, but is a matter of practical politics.
Dictatorial regimes also applaud human rights policy, but a credible human rights policy means an active policy that affects people's real lives.
Accordingly, the European Union too is judged across the world by its everyday political actions, by the way it protects human rights on an everyday basis.
Here trade and economic policy must yield to the primacy of human rights policy.
Here, the dictators of the world must never again be able to be confident that they will not be called to account.
The European Union will also be judged by whether it turns the 'International Court of Justice' project into an effective organisation by ratifying it and providing financial support.
Here, the Member States of the European Union must have the courage to stop exporting arms to governments that trample human rights under foot, such as the exports to Indonesia and to Turkey.
It is our international duty to speak out on every case of human rights infringements.
Here, the Commission must breathe life into the human rights clause in the treaties and not keep telling us why economic interests come first.
Human rights are universal and inviolable!
