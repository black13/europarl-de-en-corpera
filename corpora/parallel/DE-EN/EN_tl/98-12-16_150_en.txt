Mr President, Mr Camis√≥n Asensio, things are not quite as simple as you suggest.
Let me explain again.
In view of the importance the Council attaches to passenger safety in civil aviation, it is of course self-evident that it will give priority to considering any proposals on the matter that the Commission might submit to it.
As I am sure you know, under the provisions of the Treaty, which are the basis for any European Union action, it is in general up to the Commission to draw up the proposals which it considers necessary in fulfilment of its tasks.
At present, there is no Commission proposal or communication on the matter before the Council.
But let me add this: as you said, and as I of course agree, the actual background to this question is the Swissair plane crash in Canada.
But as I said, the cause of this disaster has not yet been established.
The investigations are concentrating not just on materials such as Mylar and Tedlar, but far more on three other aspects.
The first is the insulation of cables in the cockpit area with Kapton, the insulating material made from Mylar and Tedlar, and the aircraft's interactive audio-video system.
The parts of these insulating materials which have so far been recovered do not suggest that thermal action could have caused the accident.
The US Federal Aviation Authority investigated and certified the heat-resistance of these materials before authorising their use in civil aviation.
These tests are now being tightened up, and of course the insulating material must certainly be looked at closely so that it can be excluded as a risk factor.
But let me repeat: at this stage, it is too early to exclude any particular material as the cause of the accident, and nor should one do so, because every possible cause must continue to be investigated so that we do not come to any over-hasty conclusions and thereby disregard other potential sources of risk.
