Mr President, Madam President-in-Office, you have just given us some very interesting information.
So let me return to one of my ancient hobby-horses, which is the danger of too much hand luggage in the aircraft.
I know you are preparing certain measures to finally make flying really safe throughout Europe.
We kept hearing that this required national or airline company decisions.
But these do not address the fact that too much hand luggage represents the greatest danger to passengers in the event of a crisis.
So it would be important finally to implement the provisions that were once discussed in IATA, and to restrict hand luggage to one piece.
