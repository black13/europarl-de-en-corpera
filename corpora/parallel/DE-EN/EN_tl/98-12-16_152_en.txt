Mr President, Mr von Habsburg, let me reply as follows.
Of course all of us frequent fliers know that you are quite right here, because excess luggage can naturally be a great risk.
But I can in fact tell you that both the airlines themselves and the various international organisations concerned with flight safety are devoting constant attention to this particular issue, which means that it is still being examined and in future things will no doubt go in the direction you are advocating, although of course for all us frequent fliers that could make life more difficult.
