Mr President, let me say to Mr Alavanos that in principle we are glad that the Greek-Cypriot Government made constructive proposals regarding participation by the Northern Cypriot delegation in the accession negotiations.
It is of course regrettable that this failed.
Our aim, let me repeat, is membership of an undivided island.
To be an EU Member State, we want a Cyprus that has achieved a lasting political solution.
Any other option would be less good.
