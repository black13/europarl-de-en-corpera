Mr President, Mrs McIntosh, my positive words still stand.
Our objective is indeed the accession of an undivided island.
At the same time, it must of course be clear that no third country can have a veto in the EU enlargement process.
If no political settlement can be reached, we will probably have to ask ourselves who is mainly responsible for that.
At present that is all I can say in reply to your question whether there may be a delay.
At the same time, at present there is still some hope of working towards a solution based on a political settlement - and we encourage both sides to do so - under the United Nations process.
