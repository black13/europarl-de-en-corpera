Mr President, Mrs McKenna, as I indicated earlier, these are of course very technically complex and expensive systems.
However, I think there is a great difference between what happened when Mr Kissinger was tackling this problem and the present situation.
That case was concerned with what was happening in a building inside the Soviet Union, surrounded by many other buildings, where it was certainly easier to install devices of this kind.
Now we are concerned mainly with European buildings in European countries, and the situation is quite different.
That is why we must take account of this different situation, which I would certainly describe as less dangerous.
