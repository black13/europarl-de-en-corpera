Mr Izquierdo Collado, let me answer as follows.
It does seem a little early at this stage to discuss future measures when we all know how difficult it will be even to hold the referendum and when we are all, at this moment, struggling to ensure that a referendum is held at all.
It is quite clear that of course there will be a range of aid projects and measures following the referendum, and indeed a range of such projects already exists.
I myself am Minister for Development Cooperation, and all I can say is that apart from the European Union's official programmes there are of course also the ECHO bilateral programmes.
But it really is too soon to speculate on what will happen later.
Let us wait for the results of the referendum, and here we must support the United Nations by doing all we can to ensure that the referendum takes place at all.
We all know that there are still some obstacles in its way; once they have been overcome, we will gladly consider and also be in a position to propose a practical programme.
