Mr President, Mr Carnero Gonz√°lez, on the first question, it is quite clear that of course the Austrian Presidency is not the only one to discuss this important issue and, as I said, things do not always have to be done in public.
So here we have determined on a confidential basis and in continuous contacts with the United Nations where we can take supportive action.
I am sure I can say the same for the German Presidency, because this is indeed a question that concerns us all very much and where we must finally see some progress.
In reply to the other questions, all I can really do is repeat the following: the reason why this issue did not feature in the Vienna conclusions is that it was quite deliberately decided not to list every political issue where there is a conflict, a problem, in the conclusions.
In Vienna we were concerned with efficiency, and please note that this was also true of the Spanish member of the Council.
Mr President, I hope that answers the question.
Thank you!
