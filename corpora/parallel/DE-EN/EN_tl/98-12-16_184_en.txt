Mrs González Álvarez, let me say that I too consider this question at least as important before the referendum as after the referendum.
I said that a moment ago, for the difficulties will remain so long as we have not had a referendum at all.
As I have just tried to explain, we are of course fully aware of Morocco's attempts to delay matters here by constantly raising new questions.
But I believe that nevertheless at this point we must continue along that road.
On the basis of the identification lists that already exist, it is most likely that the outcome of the referendum will favour the Polisario.
There is, of course, the risk that Morocco will not accept that.
That means that if this whole process does not move forward by the end of January then, as the UN Secretary-General proposes in his latest report: 'Should the prospects for completing the identification process remain uncertain by that time, it would be my intention to revert to the Security Council and to ask my personal envoy - James Baker - to reassess the situation and the viability of the mandate of MINURSO'.
So if there is no success by the end of January, the question will also arise of whether the international community is interested in extending MINURSO's mandate.
Members of the American Congress will also ask whether this venture is of any use.
So other political considerations will perhaps also have to be taken into account at that point, although it is too soon to do so today.
