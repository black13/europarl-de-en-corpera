Mr President, Madam President-in-Office, I am disappointed at your answer to my question.
You said the presidency will support the measures and initiatives taken by Kofi Annan of the UN.
I had asked whether the troika is prepared to give active support to the UN's proposal that a referendum should be held.
You said that no measures had been taken and nor were any in prospect for the future.
I think we must plan for the referendum now - one year is not a very long time - and I hoped you would say that you had made provision for peace observers in the form of an EU contingent of 2 000 or 3 000 troops or of an infrastructure.
I think the people deserve that.
They have been living in refugee camps for years.
This area has been occupied!
After the Spaniards left, the EU - Mr President, do not look at the clock yet, because this concerns my question, which was not answered.
My supplementary question is as follows: next year a new fisheries agreement is to be signed with Morocco.
Is the presidency prepared to lay down conditions here, for example that if Morocco does not allow the referendum to be held, there will not be a new fisheries agreement either?
Where is the frontier, at which degree of latitude does the coastal region belong to Morocco and at which to Western Sahara?
That is my supplementary question.
