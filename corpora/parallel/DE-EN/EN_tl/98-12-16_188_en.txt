Mr President, Mr Telk√§mper, I fear you were not here earlier, when I explained that in fact Austria, which currently holds the presidency, has had a contingent of 260 troops on stand-by for the past year, with the approval indeed of Parliament, so that they could be deployed as quickly as possible - in fact six months before the referendum - and make optimum preparations for that referendum.
Unfortunately, that did not prove possible because of the poor progress made with the identification process.
But I have already said all that.
Why was there no troika mission?
As I said in my first statement, I myself have had extremely close contacts with the UN Secretary-General on this question since the last General Assembly.
After all, the UN is an institution that is recognised worldwide and which, moreover, really has done good work on this particular issue - I am thinking here of the special envoy, James Baker, whom I also referred to earlier.
We considered whether we should conduct a joint mission with the United Nations and with James Baker.
At the time, the UN considered the time was not ripe.
I said we do not want to duplicate our activity, because that would achieve nothing, but wish to make a real contribution to resolving the question.
As regards the fisheries agreement, I must say that the next presidency will probably have to decide that.
It is too early to answer that question.
