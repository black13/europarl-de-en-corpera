Madam President-in-Office, thank you for your account of the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
I would like to put two brief questions.
The first concerns the refugee problem to which you referred briefly at the end.
Of course the refugee problem is also closely bound up with the corresponding legislation, not just in Bosnia-Herzegovina but also in the neighbouring countries.
For instance, I know that Croatia has already revoked certain laws relating to housing that was allocated to refugees for the long term but to which other refugees now want to return, and I do hope that there will soon be legislation in place in Bosnia-Herzegovina that allows them to do so.
Do you know whether there are any indications that the legal situation will be adjusted accordingly?
With reference to the countries that are co-signatories to the Dayton Accord - which also include Croatia - my second question is this: what do you think the situation in Croatia is at present, and what must Croatia do so that the PHARE programme can be fully implemented there again and so that Croatia is able to follow an orderly European course?
