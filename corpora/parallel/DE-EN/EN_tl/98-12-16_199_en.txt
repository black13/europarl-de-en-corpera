Mr President, Madam President-in-Office, many thanks for the expertise with which you have answered not just this question but all our questions over the past six months.
Nevertheless, let me make one critical observation, addressed not to you personally but to the Council.
I regard the term 'western Balkans' as a most unfortunate one.
It is a quite artificial concept and refers to something that has never really existed.
Croatia was never Balkan, Macedonia is Balkan.
There never really was a 'western Balkans', and it is a totally artificial concept.
I tend to believe that we should develop a kind of democratic, positive domino theory and stabilise one country after another.
If we want to stabilise Bosnia-Herzegovina, we must first stabilise Croatia, and as far as the PHARE programme and the trade and cooperation agreement are concerned we cannot rank it lower than, say, Albania.
There is no objective reason whatsoever for doing so.
I believe that the Council should rethink these criteria and try to break through Croatia's isolation, since no progress can be achieved through isolation.
