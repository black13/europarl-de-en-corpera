Mr President, Commissioner, I would also like to begin by thanking Mrs Schaffner for making a serious attempt to get to grips with respect for human rights in the European Union.
I would not like to thank or give recognition to those who, as in previous years, have used the pretext of human rights to formulate every conceivable political idea and ideological wish and introduce them as amendments.
Unfortunately, in doing so they have distorted Mrs Schaffner's report.
There are other amendments to come which are in my opinion unacceptable, at least in the context of a discussion on human rights.
I would like to single out a few points here, such as the call for the legalisation of drug-taking, on which there are totally different views, or the demand for immigrant workers to be given the right to vote and to stand as a candidate in local elections.
Another point concerns granting homosexual couples equal status to that of the conventional family, which implies the recognition of homosexual couples as a family and even their right to establish a family.
What I find serious is the fact that calls are being made to remove the regulations protecting young people from homosexual approaches and to lower the age of consent.
I am against all forms of discrimination, but the demands made here are in my opinion absolutely unacceptable.
Protecting the young, protecting children should always be given priority over the desire to give expression to individual sexual orientation.
The protection of the young, ladies and gentlemen - those of you who call for it - is in my view a human right.
Human rights are too valuable to be used, and abused, as a vehicle for ideologies.
