Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Gradin, this year the European Parliament's annual report on respect for human rights in the European Union is of particular significance.
After all, this year we are celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
I am particularly pleased that on the occasion of this anniversary we have today been able to deal directly with human rights inside and outside the Union.
This also makes it clear to the public that the Members of the European Parliament demand respect for human rights throughout the world.
The effect of this signal must not be underestimated.
Too often, Member States are themselves accused of violating human rights within their own borders, while at the same time trying to compel their trading partners to observe them by including human rights clauses in their trade agreements.
In this report we also make it clear that the personal rights of vulnerable and socially excluded persons are being violated.
It is in accordance with the intellectual tradition of Europe that the European Parliament, despite all hostility even from its own ranks, will not allow itself to be deterred from pointing out the flaws in our democracy.
I therefore consider it to be particularly important that the report on human rights deals with the situation of refugees and foreigners, children and minority groups.
In general they have no voting rights, and cannot therefore be involved in electing government.
If they are subjected to human rights violations these often go unpunished.
We then say it is their own fault, they themselves are to blame, they do not fit in.
These are the excuses that are given all too often for extreme incidents.
But whether people are foreign, whether they are normal or not, they are still human beings, they still have rights and they therefore deserve respect.
It is precisely this that our report aims to bring home to the governments of Europe.
