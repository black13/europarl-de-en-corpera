Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we in the Green Group would have liked to establish even broader consumer protection at first reading.
We had requested a five-year guarantee period in order to increase the incentive to produce durable products, as it should be clear that we need to embody the principle of durability in consumer protection also.
We therefore regret that there was not a majority for this at the time.
But I think that a two-year guarantee period is at least better than six months, as is the current situation in Germany, which unfortunately ranks lowest in this area.
I think that it is fundamentally important that we should give consumers greater protection here, and this includes providing the consumer with this guarantee.
However, it should not lead to a situation a minor defect is viewed as a further violation of the principle of durability.
For example, if there is a small stain on a carpet it should not mean that the whole carpet must be disposed of, which would also not guarantee that the environmental aspect would be taken into account.
We also consider joint liability of the manufacturer and the seller to be fundamental, and this really must be included in this directive.
Of course it is also essential that the period of obligation to notify a fault is not reduced, so that the rights of the buyer and the consumer in this area are not restricted.
We would actually have liked these rights to be extended, but on the whole, I think, we are reasonably pleased with the report.
I would like to mention one final point.
I would have preferred to have an obligation to label a product with the length of its total useful life so that the consumer really can determine policy with his shopping trolley, so that he can exert pressure in this area to ensure that genuinely durable products are made.
That is our concern, and it is clear that we must make sure that these aims are realised by linking environmental and consumer protection.
