Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is clear to everyone who is interested in the health of the environment that the Kyoto Protocol established essential framework conditions for curbing CO2 emissions.
The European Union agreed with the other parties to the Convention to set legally binding reduction targets for the emission of carbon dioxide.
The fact that emissions from passenger cars account for 12 % of all CO2 emissions in the European Union means that all responsible people involved in environmental policy are compelled to take rapid action.
The Community had set itself the target of reducing specific CO2 emissions from new passenger cars to 120g/km by the year 2000.
However, today we still do not have a system at EU level to monitor properly whether this target is being achieved.
But in order to be able to identify the effectiveness of the various measures as quickly as possible and to introduce guidelines if necessary, an appropriate monitoring system is absolutely essential.
As proposed in the present report, this can only be achieved by officially recording the specific consumption levels, net weight, maximum net power and engine capacity of newly registered passenger cars.
The advantages of this are not just about being able to measure the success of consumption-reducing measures, but also about identifying the main trends in transport policy.
The measures proposed in this report go a considerable way towards implementing the Kyoto Protocol, as targets alone are not enough to prevent negative effects on the world climate.
It is also essential to lay down monitoring standards and to control these very closely.
It is only in this way that the European Union can play its undoubtedly important role in ensuring that the Kyoto Protocol is more than just fine words.
