Commissioner, I would like to ask a question concerning light commercial vehicles.
Of course we know that, in the context of type-approval under Directive 70/156, no standards exist as yet for recording CO2 emissions for light commercial vehicles.
But naturally such standards can be created.
So if we say we need them, Directive 70/156 must be amended.
Incidentally, in the Auto-oil legislation, a recital in the new Directive 98/69 calls for just this.
So what is to prevent the Commission from submitting a proposal for an amendment to this effect?
