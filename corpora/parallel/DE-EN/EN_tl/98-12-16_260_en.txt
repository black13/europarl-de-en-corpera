Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too am disappointed in this report.
I think it is disgraceful that we are talking about the protection of the ozone layer and yet we allow the worst ozone killer - methyl bromide - to remain on the market!
The European Parliament has allowed itself to be controlled by short-sighted, national lobbies, and this is highly regrettable.
We all know that methyl bromide is one of the worst ozone-depleting substances.
But there is no point in bemoaning the fact that the ozone hole has increased if we do not take appropriate measures to prevent it.
I find it highly regrettable that the European Commission has not proposed introducing this ban from 2001 onwards.
The large groups only want it from 2004, in any case.
I think this is inconsistent with what is being done in the individual Member States, and I think it is particularly regrettable given the fact that there are alternatives, as several Member States have demonstrated.
I find it quite disgraceful that we are allowing irreversible damage to the ecosystem - and also damage to health in the form of skin cancer, for example - in order to give in to lobby pressure.
