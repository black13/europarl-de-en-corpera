Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this Vienna summit has brought few concrete results.
Whether this was a summit that set a new course, only the future can tell.
I would not wish to reproach the presidency of the Council for not being able to achieve everything it set out to achieve.
It is understandable that the difficult and controversial package of Agenda 2000 could not be brought to a conclusion.
After all, Agenda 2000 concerns interests rather than visions.
That is what makes things so difficult, and it means that a political decision will probably be taken in what some commentators have called the 'night when heads start to roll'.
The disappointment of Vienna is reflected in other areas too, especially employment.
The Vienna strategy may well designate employment as the top priority, but it is marked by a paucity of concrete proposals.
No qualitative or quantitative objectives were fixed.
So there has been nothing concrete since Luxembourg.
Freely following the motto 'what we cannot do now we shall put off till later', the Vienna meeting did in the end produce one result: it fixed the agenda for the next meeting.
That is a rather miserable result for 17 million unemployed.
The guarded comments of the social democratic family of Europe are unlikely to offer much consolation to the unemployed.
