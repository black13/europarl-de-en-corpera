Mr President, the President-in-Office of the Council gave us an impressive list of all the issues discussed at the Vienna summit.
I am happy to acknowledge that, but unfortunately none of it has penetrated through to the outside world.
What has come through is that there were negotiations about money.
Perhaps that is partly to do with the new German approach.
I would certainly not dispute that.
Obviously, things were done differently in the past.
More information about the substance of policies used to penetrate through to the outside world and people would haggle about money at midday around the fireplace.
Perhaps that was a better system.
At any rate, at this summit not much got through of the visions which Chancellor Klima said should be opened up for the citizens.
Admittedly, the Austrian Government has achieved a great deal in terms of agricultural policy in its discussions with Parliament - or at least when Mr Molterer was present in the committee - and defined directions and outlined courses to be followed.
I do not dispute that.
But what was not addressed at this summit was the fact that employment is also linked to the stabilisation of agricultural structures and structural development.
That did not come through, even though it opens up new prospects, and I am very sorry that at this high level no account is evidently taken of the need to connect with the people.
