Mr President, we are back to the usual routine.
Once again a summit has declared that employment is the top priority.
Once again nothing has come of the new emphasis Parliament had expected to be put on coordinating economic and monetary policy.
The recommendation that additional, quantifiable objectives and timetables should be laid down at national level is commendable.
But there are no concrete agreements.
One exception, Mr Fischler, is the European Commission.
Mr Santer said that existing programmes will be packaged together.
We will target them at the ESF and at employment.
That is indeed a European added value, a major initiative.
Yet it is highly questionable whether we will obtain the employment pact at European level which the Germans are to achieve by March.
The new German Government is endeavouring to preach the virtues of this package at national level, but with little result.
Chancellor Schr√∂der, who is inexperienced in office, and particularly so at European level, is providing against the future by saying that we must not place too high hopes in the German Presidency.
The Austrian Foreign Minister is right on one point, when he said that much improvement is still needed in relation to foreign and security policy - something which also applies to employment.
There is nothing further we can add.
