Mr President, no spectacular decisions have been taken in the Council over the past six months, but Austria's diligent diplomacy has taken the Community forward.
I wish to concentrate on one particular area: promoting the social dialogue.
At business level, let me refer you to the Austrian compromise proposal on a European limited company, which follows years of discussion.
In 1997, the European Parliament made it clear that it is important to prevent certain national codetermination systems from simply being exported, but also to prevent any weakening of codetermination in countries which already have far-reaching rights.
The Austrian compromise largely satisfies these demands.
But we have had enough discussions now.
We expect the forthcoming German Presidency finally to bring about a political agreement on the sound basis of the Austrian proposal.
