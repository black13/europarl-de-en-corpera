Mr President, the Vienna summit will go down in the history of the European Union as the Great Procrastination.
That is certainly not the fault of the Austrian Presidency.
I find it all the more regrettable in view of the fact that the presidency is about to pass to the new German Government, which has already proved on several occasions to be so inexperienced that the contradictory statements of its spokespersons - whom certain major French newspapers regard as absolute dilettantes - have already broken a fair quantity of china even before the guests have arrived.
In the present difficult situation, the EU deserves better than to be put at the mercy of raw debutants on the European stage.
But the Council, of course, still has politicians with experience, realism and a sense of responsibility.
And, thank heaven, in matters where vital interests of the Member States are at stake, such as fiscal policy, unanimity is still required, so there is hope that damage limitation can be successfully pursued during the next six months.
I am not one of those who deplore the fact that the Vienna summit dealt with the duty-free problem.
Indeed, I believe that one of the most tangible successes or results of the summit was the mandate given to the Commission, which has refused to yield to our pressure on this matter.
In the present employment situation, we urgently need a stay of execution for duty-free shops, at least until 2002, when we shall have euro notes and coins in our purses and wallets.
Tax-free sales will not turn the single market upside-down.
The costs involved in running an airport, which are currently defrayed by revenue from duty-free sales, will have to be met from other taxes once the curtain falls on duty-free.
It is na√Øve to claim that duty-free sales result in revenue shortfalls that the Member States can ill afford.
The abolition of duty-free is liable to cost more than it would allegedly yield in excise duties.
