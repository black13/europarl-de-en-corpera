Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament supports the OSCE Ministerial Council in its appeal to the parties involved in the Trans-Dniestrian conflict and agrees that it is high time the latter took decisive action to find a solution to the conflict.
We are well aware of the efforts of the OSCE mission, which is seeking peace in the region on a shoestring budget, with a great deal of commitment and often with restrictions on the exercise of its mandate.
We know that any solution must respect the internationally recognised borders of Moldova.
The situation is complicated by the fact that the agreed withdrawal of the Russian forces is being delayed by Moscow and is further complicated by the storage in Trans-Dniestria of huge quantities of arms and ammunition, as has already been mentioned.
Moldova - and this is repeatedly forgotten here - was subject to the same fate as the former German Democratic Republic, spending 40 years under Soviet rule.
Moldova has applied for membership of the European Union.
That is repeatedly ignored here.
We should offer this particular neighbour a solution in the framework of the European Conference, in the context of the enlarged Union, and I ask the Commissioner to suggest which strategies the Commission might have for Moldova over and above the partnership and cooperation agreement.
