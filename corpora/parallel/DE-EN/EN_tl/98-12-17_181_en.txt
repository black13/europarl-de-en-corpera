Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, human rights are indivisible.
That has been the motto of this Human Rights Week.
Human rights also apply to those who have committed offences and are in prison.
They too must be given the opportunity to acknowledge their guilt and to start a new life.
That is why recognition of the universality of human rights goes hand in hand with rejection of the death penalty.
Three women and two men are sitting in death cells in Turkmenistan.
They may be executed within the next few days.
Their last hope is that they will be granted a reprieve from the President of Turkmenistan.
That would not diminish their guilt, but it would be an act of respect for human rights.
We therefore call on the President of Turkmenistan to summon up the courage to carry out this act of mercy, thereby according precedence to international human rights over national law.
That would also enhance the credibility of his celebrations for the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
