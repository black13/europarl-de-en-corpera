Mr President, I can only endorse the words of the previous speakers.
However, I should like to repeat their message in slightly different terms.
Yesterday a group of visitors asked me why we oppose the death penalty.
I believe our resolution illustrates very clearly why we do.
Every case is different, and the yardsticks by which cases are judged often differ too, but once every legal appeal and every petition for a reprieve has been rejected, all that remains is a final and irrevocable sentence.
That is why, in the Treaty of Amsterdam, the EU recommends that its Member States abolish the death penalty for all time to come, and we are certainly pleased about that.
We note with great concern, however, that in this respect the United States and its constituent states - death-penalty statutes being the responsibility of individual state legislatures - are regrettably putting themselves on the same level as countries with which they would not wish to be compared.
For that reason, our appeal for the abolition of capital punishment is especially directed at them, but it is also addressed to the other nations of the world.
The death penalty is final; it is irrevocable, and when the sentence is carried out, clemency and humanity become irrelevant.
