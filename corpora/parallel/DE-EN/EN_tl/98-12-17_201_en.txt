Mr President, the events of the last few hours have demonstrated especially clearly the importance of Iran to us.
No objective observer of the situation there can be in any doubt of the enormous progress that has been made in Iran under President Khatami.
Accidents will happen - that is only to be expected - but most of the trouble is orchestrated in other countries.
That must not be forgotten.
Time and again it is the same Iranian freedom fighters who import terrorism into the country.
We should therefore make every effort to encourage the Iranian Government, and especially the President, to continue along the path of liberalisation and democratisation.
There is, however, one point that we must make as forcefully as possible.
It concerns the intolerable persecution of the Bahai, for the Bahai are one of the most civilised groups, and we must support them in the exercise of their freedom.
