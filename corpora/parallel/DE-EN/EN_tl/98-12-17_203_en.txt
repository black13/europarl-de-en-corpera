Mr President, we live and learn!
I am genuinely surprised to hear how favourably Mr von Habsburg assesses the Iranian situation.
I am very much on the side of the Bahai and agree that they must not be persecuted.
But to act as if everything that has been said about women, about intellectuals and about critics of the regime was irrelevant - I am simply stunned!
It is certainly true, and this is how I had actually planned to begin, that Iran has a new President, for whom, on the basis of his statements and attitudes, I certainly have a high regard, even if I do not agree with him on every detail.
But perhaps it is precisely because a relatively liberal President has been elected by the people against the wishes of the ayatollahs, or at least of the fundamentalist ayatollahs, that there is a definite current within the country which seeks to exorcise the spectre of liberalism and which is mounting a massive campaign against foreign influence and liberalisation in the country.
But these things have to be kept in perspective, and it is certainly possible to envisage a continuation of dialogue with Iran.
However, any dialogue, whether we call it critical or open, must be conducted on the clear understanding that Parliament cannot refrain from putting human rights in Iran, as in many other countries, at the heart of its deliberations and that it is duty bound to wage this campaign.
We certainly must also call on the Commission and the Council to keep a very watchful eye on the development of human rights.
Yes, we support dialogue with the President of Iran.
We hope that he will speak increasingly for the whole of the Iranian nation.
But he will only be able to do so if he is strong enough to wage a successful struggle against the fundamentalists and the groups who engage in or condone terrorism.
I therefore hope that the Commission and the Council will see the situation in the same light as this Parliament.
