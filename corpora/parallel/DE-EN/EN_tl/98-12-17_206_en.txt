Mr President, my honourable colleague Mr Bertens has already given us the horrifying statistic: 300 000 children are fighting in armed conflicts throughout the world.
Some of them are only eight years old.
In the past ten years, two million such children have been killed and six million permanently maimed.
Countless psychological traumas are another legacy of these exposures to violence.
There are even many countries in the European Union which have not signed the protocol to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child which prohibits the recruitment of service personnel under the age of 18.
Young people under the age of 18 can join the armed forces in France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom.
The implementation of this protocol is a political imperative if the European Union wants to preserve its credibility and if the world is to believe the current President-in-Office of the Council when he says that human rights have become a key element in the policies of the European Union.
It would therefore be logical for the European Union to engage in a joint action for the implementation of the protocol in order to ensure that children are properly protected.
There is a particular need for such an example in our own countries, especially since the Cardiff summit adopted a guideline in the code of conduct for arms exports which clearly emphasised that the key role for ...
(The President interrupted the speaker) ... increasing international observance of the protocol on light firearms is particularly essential in those countries where children are used as soldiers.
To these words ...
(The President cut the speaker off)
