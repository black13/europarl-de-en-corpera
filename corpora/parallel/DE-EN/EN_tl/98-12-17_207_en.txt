Mr President, instead of sharing our children's joyful anticipation of the festive season, we are dealing today in our resolution with one of the saddest chapters in the history of human exploitation, not to say crime.
I know from my own childhood what it means to send 14- and 15-year-old children into battle as a last resort, and I shall never forget that.
I am sickened whenever I recall the fate of the child soldiers who were sent to war in the Iran-Iraq conflict and in conflicts in other countries in the name of fanaticism.
I therefore believe that we in the European Union should support all the efforts of the United Nations to conclude an additional protocol to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.
The EU must act accordingly.
Of course, it is not the practice in our countries for young people under the age of 18 to be sent to war - we should be aware of that - but I am still in favour of setting an absolute limit at 18.
We in the European Union have dared to abolish war.
War is horrific, even for adults, as we can still see today at our borders, but we should also ensure that, in other countries where wars are being waged, children are never made to experience the horrors of war at first hand, to suffer the trauma that will haunt them for the rest of their lives.
So let us commit ourselves in the European Parliament to children's happiness, to ensuring that they are free from hunger, that they are educated and that they are never used as child soldiers.
