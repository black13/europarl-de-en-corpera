Mr President, this new Macedonian Government is led by a party which for many years, and in some respects for several decades, has been striking a stridently nationalist tone and has been pursuing a highly nationalistic policy.
I should be delighted if the hints of moderation that have been discernible over the last few weeks and months actually turn out to reflect the true nature of this new government.
It should be given the benefit of the doubt as well as opportunities to prove itself.
I am in complete agreement with the thrust of this resolution, which is designed to re-establish the freedom of the Albanians, who have been receiving unduly harsh treatment.
Some of us in the delegation have already discussed this on several occasions with the Macedonians.
I myself, along with my colleague Mrs Pack, met with one of the prisoners before he began to serve his sentence in Skopje.
I believe it would be a true sign of strength and vision if these Albanians were now given their freedom.
