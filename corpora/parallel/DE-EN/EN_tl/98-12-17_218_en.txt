Mr President, before we come to the Pradier report, there is something else I have to point out.
Today's voting and the topical and urgent matters were slightly in breach of the Rules of Procedure, because we again had only the joint texts translated and not the original texts.
In theory, we have the right - and we have often exercised it - to reject joint texts and then vote on the originals.
This right, however, is denied us if the original texts are not available in the original languages, as is customary with all other votes.
I know that a decision of some sort was probably taken by the Bureau.
I am merely protesting about that decision.
It is entirely contrary to the Rules of Procedure, and I ask you to submit the matter to the Rules Committee.
