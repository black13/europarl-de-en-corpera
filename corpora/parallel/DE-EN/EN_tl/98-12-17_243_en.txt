Madam President, as a new Member of Parliament, I had a compilation put together of the debates that have taken place in the House on xenophobia and racism.
Since the French Front National first entered Parliament, the House has had to discuss this issue many times.
The report of the first committee of inquiry on the subject dates from 1985.
A second committee of inquiry was convened in 1989 because of the arrival of the German Republicans in the European Parliament.
We must continue to examine this problem, even though it has already been the subject of two quite thorough analyses.
Parties headed by gentlemen such as Le Pen, Haider and Frey are scoring considerable electoral successes in France, Austria and Germany today.
Sadly, in recent years xenophobic and racist crimes have claimed several victims in Europe.
Not until Amsterdam did the Member States respond to the repeated demands and reports they had been receiving from Parliament.
Unfortunately, we have wasted a great deal of time since Maastricht.
Be that as it may, we should now draw the necessary conclusions and flesh out the new legal basis for the fight against all forms of discrimination and racism in the European Union.
A policy of equal rights is essential if we are to overcome xenophobia and racism.
For that reason, plans of action to combat racism are not enough.
Harmonisation of the various laws in the Member States against xenophobia and racism should be our next objective.
That is the only way in which we can create the conditions for all Europeans to live together in peace and equality.
