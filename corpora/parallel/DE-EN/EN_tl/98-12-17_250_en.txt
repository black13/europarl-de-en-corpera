Madam President, I believe Thomas Mann asked the very question that needs to be asked here: what causes racism?
To that I would add a second question, which has also just been raised.
It was asserted that we had made great progress in combating racism.
I believe a great deal more caution is called for, because racism itself has developed.
It undoubtedly remains extremely dangerous.
There is still racial violence on our streets.
Has it somehow been reduced?
Well, it may be that statistics from an individual country have gone down, but crime statistics depend to an extent on how the number of unreported cases is estimated.
In other words, we really do have to ask ourselves why this problem has reached such epidemic proportions in our European Union.
I believe this actually leads us to ask two more questions.
Is there a connection with mass unemployment, with the policy of diminishing solidarity and fiercer competition that we have been pursuing for the past 15 to 20 years?
Is there a connection with European history - European history as the history of the colonies, as the history of Europe's imperialist pretensions, and European history as the history of this century?
The history of the German wars, of German racism in Europe?
I believe that unless we remember and carefully examine that history, we shall keep falling into the same trap of adopting a host of minor piecemeal measures which do nothing to solve the problem.
We must not do that!
It is our duty to remember, and it is our duty to get to grips with our problems.
