Mr President, that is precisely what I said.
We have a decision and a resolution.
That is what the Rules of Procedure require.
The decision lays down what is to be done, what Parliament has decided, as you just said.
The resolution contains the remarks relating to the decision, the action to be taken.
This is what the section beginning with paragraph 26 is about.
