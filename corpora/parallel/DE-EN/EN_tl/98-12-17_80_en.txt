Mr President, we adopted this Amendment No 15 in committee, but unfortunately the representative of the Commission who was attending our committee meeting did not inform us of the existence of a judgment delivered by the European Court of Justice in July of this year, which states that in the European Union the use, and hence the marketing, of HCFCs in fire extinguishers is prohibited.
In this amendment we have therefore put ourselves at odds with a judgment of the Court of Justice.
I should never have voted for this amendment if I had known that beforehand.
The Commission did not tell us about this until yesterday evening, and I believe the rest of the committee would not have voted for the amendment either.
May I therefore recommend to the House that it votes against this amendment, since I do not believe that a judgment of the Court should be overturned through the back door by means of an amendment.
(Parliament rejected the amendment)
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
