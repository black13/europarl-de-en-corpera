Madam President, on behalf of my group I should like to express my warm congratulations to Robert Evans on his reporting and to re-emphasise the importance of the Tempus programme.
For the new democracies in the East in particular, it is very important that cooperation should take place in the areas of education and culture.
These are certainly two fields in which we can truly cooperate as equal partners with the new democracies and the future members of the European Union.
That is why I particularly emphasise the importance of this programme.
