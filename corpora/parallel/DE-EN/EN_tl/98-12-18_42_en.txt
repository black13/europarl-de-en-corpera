Madam President, the type of cooperation envisaged in Tempus will open up entirely new regions to the European Union.
As far as the current Tempus III programme is concerned, I believe it is especially important that the greatest of care should be taken to match the various priorities very closely with the national needs of the target countries.
The Commission must ensure, in the light of the criticism expressed in the evaluation report, that the new programme is implemented far more efficiently.
Precisely because the measures in the realm of tertiary education have a really vital role to play in the integration process, a huge responsibility falls on the Commission and all other players in this field.
I am right behind the rapporteur when he says that the mobility grants should also be available to students.
Not only are they by no means a 'quantité négligeable ', as he says; they are in fact the software around which the whole system revolves.
