You need have no worries about saying 'Wijsenbeek', Madam President.
Your pronunciation is just fine!
And even if Mrs Fontaine does not always manage it, I have long since forgiven her!
(Laughter)
That is Mr Goedbloed, to make matters even worse.
Madam President, I am referring to the Minutes, pages 11, 12 and 13.
I referred to this yesterday.
Mr Elles, the rapporteur from the Committee on Budgetary Control, and the President both pointed out that they found our Rules of Procedure strange.
May I assume, Madam President, that as a result of this, the presidency of the House, if not the Bureau, will provide us with a proposal to amend Annex V of the Rules of Procedure?
Should not the Bureau have spoken of this much sooner and therefore have raised it much earlier in the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, rather than convening us on a Monday afternoon in a kind of emergency procedure, when we could no longer of course do anything about it.
