This report highlights a problem without really addressing it.
The completion of the single European market has turned out to be a far more complex political regulatory task than was envisaged in the original strategy, which essentially relied on the automatic apolitical functioning of the deregulated market forces.
We certainly know now that it will not be possible to find a sustainable solution to this problem without a new beginning in political terms, to provide a basis for an adequate fundamental consensus among the Member States of the EU on social policy and an efficient Community regulatory framework.
The change of government in Germany has made this possible within the EU.
All that has to be done is to seize this opportunity resolutely and not squander it by engaging in disputes over short-term interests.
Mr Garc√≠a-Margallo y Marfil's report, unfortunately, is still too heavily based on a technocratic damage-limitation mentality to serve as a means of grasping this key political opportunity; parts of the report even reveal vestiges of the illusions of free-market radicalism regarding the 'self-generation' of the single market.
That is regrettable.
But nothing in the report is absolutely mistaken either.
For that reason, our group will abstain from voting.
