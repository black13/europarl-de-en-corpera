Madam President, may I ask that this be done very quickly, because we do have to report back to the House in January; that is what the current Rules of Procedure prescribe.
I do not consider that possible if the texts which have to be recorded in the Minutes are not there.
This way, I only have the result which is printed in the first part of the Minutes.
This naturally means that certain inconsistencies might occur in the wording.
