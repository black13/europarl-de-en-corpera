Mr President, our group requests that the debate on Agenda 2000, in other words the reform of agriculture policy, and the vote on the reports discussed should not be held at different times.
We asked for the vote to be held this week, but if this is not possible for reasons of time, we believe it would be better to postpone the entire debate plus the vote until the Brussels part-session.
Voting is not a technical act, but one of great political importance.
We must not uncouple the debate, which is concerned primarily with amendments and examination of the various issues, from the vote.
I trust the House will be amenable to our proposal.
