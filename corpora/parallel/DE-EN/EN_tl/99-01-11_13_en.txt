Mr President, whilst I believe a vote of confidence to be extremely important, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf is quite right in saying that Agenda 2000 is a matter of great political importance too.
We should not put aside everything to do with this, but should debate the market sectors on Wednesday as planned, irrespective of other events.
It would be a clear belittling of the most important issue which this House will be debating between now and the year 2006 simply to postpone it and say we will deal with this at the two-day mini-session in Brussels.
I appreciate that there is simply not time to vote on over 400 amendments.
We could certainly hold the vote in Brussels, but we should debate Agenda 2000 on Wednesday.
