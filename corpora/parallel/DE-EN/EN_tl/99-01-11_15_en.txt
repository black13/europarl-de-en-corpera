Mr President, I quite understand that the vote on Agenda 2000 and the 400 amendments to it has been postponed.
What I do not understand is that we are dealing with the Hermange report on Thursday evening but not voting on it on Friday morning, as would normally be the case.
I should like to know the reason, and I think this is a procedure which should not be repeated in future.
