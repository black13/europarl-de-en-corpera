Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with you, Mr Santer, that the issue here is confidence, trust between our institutions, but in my view, trust presupposes the clear acceptance of responsibilities.
What is the story here?
Two Commissioners are accused of serious dereliction of duty and find themselves in the firing line.
So what does the Commission do, what does the Commission President do?
All of you sitting down there can find nothing better to do than close ranks!
But you forget how easily the mud thrown at a few of you may stick to all of you.
You, ladies and gentlemen of the Commission, are unnecessarily being forced into collective responsibility by one or two of your number who, in one case at least, have now come to symbolise nepotism in the EU.
Applause
Instead of closing ranks, you would have done better to pluck up courage and at last accept your political responsibility in this dispute.
Whilst it is right that the Commission should act as a collegiate body, it is wrong to cover up the misdeeds of individual Commissioners and deny their political responsibility.
That destroys the credibility of you all!
Yours too, Mr Santer!
Do what has to be done.
Persuade Mr Marín to accept the political consequences, whatever they may be.
Mr Marín, there are many ways of saying sorry - I feel guilty, I made a mistake or I accept responsibility.
Come clean about the irregularities in Commissioner Cresson's area of responsibility.
Things which may be normal in an economy of preference and favouritism cannot go uninvestigated at European level.
Give a sign of good will in Paul Van Buitenen's case.
His loyalty was to fair play and not to the hierarchy.
You have until Thursday.
Prove that you are willing to accept political responsibility at this eleventh hour!
Applause
