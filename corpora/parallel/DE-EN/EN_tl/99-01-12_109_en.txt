Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the competition rules certainly are an important component of the acquis communautaire , but to date the competition provisions of the Europe Agreements have not prevented the EU from applying anti-dumping and trade protection measures to the applicant states, with the result that the Central and Eastern European countries face a growing trade deficit.
This is exactly the opposite of what the real task of a European Union should be, namely to promote their successful accession and economic stabilisation.
Then there are also the high export subsidies for EU agricultural products, which severely disturb the domestic markets of the applicant countries.
The real question here is: who has what homework to do?
It is not just the applicant countries; what we need is a qualitative change of direction of EU competition and trade policy towards these countries.
