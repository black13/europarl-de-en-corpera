Mr President, this is a most important matter and, as you know, in this sort of context problems are of course resolved bilaterally.
We have to proceed through the normal diplomatic channels in regard to environmental questions too.
We do not have any direct responsibility here.
We have to talk to each other, even when it is a question of aid.
If there are any grounds for complaint, the matter is usually settled confidentially, but settled it is.
If you want any further details, we can discuss this either bilaterally or with other colleagues.
