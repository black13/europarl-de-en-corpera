Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I want to come back to shipbuilding again.
Surely it is quite absurd that shipyards that are totally bankrupt by any normal business standards are continuing to operate and still winning shipbuilding contracts at the lowest dumping prices on the world market.
And this is happening not just in the normal container sector; South Korean shipyards are also moving into the area of ferries, of passenger ships, the last sector where we Europeans still have a hope of saving jobs.
Commissioner, how can you assure us that Korea will undertake to observe the provisions of Article 8, namely, in accordance with the OECD agreement which has not yet entered into force, not to take any action to support its shipbuilding industry which would distort competition?
How can we ensure that our taxpayers' money that our Member States send to Korea as aid via the European Funds, via the International Monetary Fund, does not in the end rebound on our own jobs in the European shipyards?
Nobody would be able to understand that.
I hope you can tell us how you intend to ensure that there are no unfair shipbuilding subsidies that harm our own industry.
