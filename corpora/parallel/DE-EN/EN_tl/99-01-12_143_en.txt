Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in principle the current school-milk programme has two aims.
Firstly, we want to achieve the objectives of the organisation of the dairy market and boost sales; secondly, of course, we want this school-milk programme to encourage in particular the younger generation in the European Union to drink milk and make a healthy source of nourishment available to children.
We see no reason why we should in any way change these objectives at this time.
So there are at present no plans for any revision.
But of course we must also wait and see what the Agenda 2000 negotiations produce.
In the light of that it may of course prove necessary to make certain changes and adjustments.
Furthermore, an external audit has been commissioned, which is nearly complete, and we will see what these independent external experts recommend and also adjust our future policy to that.
