Mr President, I am happy to reply to Mr Crowley's supplementary.
From my point of view I can say that I have no information on what the results of this external audit will be, but I am of course prepared to make the findings public as soon as they are available.
My personal - and I stress personal - view with regard to school milk is that in the light of reform it is worth considering even at this stage how to make this system, which is at present rather entangled in red tape, a little less bureaucratic.
Quite apart from that, on principle it must surely be in the interest of the dairy industry itself to do all it can to draw its products to the attention of the future consumers rather than just leaving it to the public administration to encourage children to consume more dairy products by subsidising them.
Here I could well imagine a combination of private-sector and Community measures, in order to achieve the best results.
