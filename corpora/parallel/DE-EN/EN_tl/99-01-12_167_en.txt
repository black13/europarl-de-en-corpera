Mr President, I would like to ask two brief supplementaries.
What part will music play in these celebrations?
There are organisations, such as 'Europa musicale', that are making very intensive preparations which also involve the applicant countries.
I wanted to ask you whether there are plans only for general festivities or also for genuine cultural events.
Secondly, I asked specifically about the Christian-Islamic-Jewish dialogue.
After all, the year 2000 refers back specifically to the birth of Christ, which is when our calendar begins, and I therefore think we should include a dialogue with our neighbours, the Muslims and Jews, as this is increasingly becoming a domestic policy issue in our countries.
That is why I ask whether there are any plans to that effect.
