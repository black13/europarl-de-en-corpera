Mr President, Commissioner, World Expo 2000 will also be taking place that year.
At that world exhibition the first attempt will be made to introduce the electronic payment system across the board on a large scale.
Visitors will be coming from all over the world, some 40 million of them.
Have you any ideas on how we can also take account, during the celebrations, of this unique event, this huge experiment?
