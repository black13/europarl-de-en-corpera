Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you are the first President-in-Office of the Council whose political legitimacy is based on the eco-movement.
I would like to point out to you that any form of politics and any political action will fail and be meaningless from the outset if the question of principle, namely how to resolve the environmental issue, is not addressed.
We are nearing the end of the 20th century and standing on the threshold of the 21st century.
Consider for a moment: we cannot afford to repeat the 20th century in terms either of wasting resources or of destroying the environment.
I wonder whether you are still using your influence in order to create an environmental vision of the future.
I hope you have not thrown out these environmental visions that have taken you where you are today, together with your legendary trainers, and let them rot away together in some cellar room.
If that is the case, please at least bring your environmental visions up into the daylight again!
