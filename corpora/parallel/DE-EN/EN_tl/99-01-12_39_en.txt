Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I was probably not the only one to greet your statement about the German Presidency's objectives with mixed feelings.
You had many good and strong things to say about your visions - an integrated Europe versus the Europe of the past, human rights, institutional reforms, the need for majority decisions to become the rule in the Council, a strong Parliament.
But why - and there are two whys given the present situation - why did you say nothing about reforming the Commission, why did you say absolutely nothing on the most important question of comitology?
Nor, for that matter, did you say very much about the operational aspects.
You spoke of a package deal in March on Agenda 2000, of lower contributions, especially by net contributors, of reducing agricultural expenditure.
In my view your statement today gave the same increasingly ambivalent impression as your statements and those of other members of your government in recent months.
I can only hope that the same does not apply to another subject you addressed again today, namely enlargement.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you said there can be no alternative to enlargement.
In the past few months Mr Schr√∂der has sent out very different signals I hope that what you have announced on behalf of the presidency as a whole will be the official programme and will be followed consistently.
The preceding presidency, the Austrian Presidency, sent out and followed very specific signals in regard to enlargement.
I hope that your presidency will also take very concrete political steps in this regard, for that is the only way we can achieve the objective we are all pursuing, namely to make the 21st century the age of integration and not the age of the past!
