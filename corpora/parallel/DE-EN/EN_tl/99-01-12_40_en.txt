Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you and the German Government rightly declared that fighting unemployment was the central aim of the German Presidency.
Obviously this cannot mean paying out billions on aid programmes.
That is not the way to combat structural unemployment.
The German Chancellor chose his words well when he wrote recently in a trade journal that the most important thing was to coordinate employment policies in the European Union.
I would say to coordinate them better, for we do not have to recreate the world all over again.
Under the last German Presidency in 1994 it was agreed to coordinate national measures.
At the Luxembourg special summit led by Jean-Claude Juncker the Essen procedure was improved by the establishment of guidelines and national action plans, which, my dear Wim van Velzen, must indeed become more verifiable!
In 1994 we achieved another success with the directive on European works councils.
This concerned the information and consultation of workers in European companies, which the then presidency declared a priority, and the much disputed question of economic co-determination.
Parliament recommended adopting the recipe for success of the European works councils as the procedural principle for European companies: flexibility, negotiations between the social partners on co-determination rights and, if that failed, European minimum standards.
By following this procedure, the Austrian compromise proposal took us very close to achieving that objective.
Now we finally need political agreement within the Council.
I wish Mr Riester, the Minister for Employment, the same success that his predecessor Mr Blum achieved with the European works councils in 1994.
