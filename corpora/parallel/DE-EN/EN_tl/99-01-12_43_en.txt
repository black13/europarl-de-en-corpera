Mr President-in-Office, I assume that you missed some of what was said because Mr Cohn-Bendit was talking to you.
I forgive you!
But I would like to say that for you simply to dismiss what I said as emotional is male arrogance, and I am happy to return the insult.
I have been concerning myself with Kosovo for ten years - a little longer, perhaps, than you - and I do not reproach you for that, just as you should not reproach me for being emotional.
I simply believe that after I have been pleading for years for prevention in Kosovo and that has not been achieved, one cannot say after ten years: we must take preventive measures.
Secondly, I also believe that I did not say the OSCE must get out and nobody else must come in; perhaps you did not hear me properly.
I said that as it stands it is not much use because there is nothing it can do.
Indeed it can achieve even less than the UN troops did in Bosnia.
In my view we need an international force there which incorporates the Russians, so as to prepare the ground for peaceful solutions.
Allow me to correct a few other words you said.
Mr Westendorp is not the representative of the European Union, he is the representative of the international community including the European Union.
Please do not misunderstand me next time!
Applause
