Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we keep being accused of being remote from the citizens and aloof.
We can only defend ourselves against this accusation by ensuring greater transparency and democratic control.
The citizens of Europe have a right to that.
Transparency and democratic control will bring us closer to the people, something we should not just think about every five years just before the elections.
Much remains to be done.
That is apparent not just from Mrs Lööw's report.
It is apparent also from the 20 conclusions set out in my opinion, which the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights approved unanimously.
What I consider most important of all is to make improved access of the citizens to information the focal point of transparency.
In this regard, Finland and Sweden have developed an enviable culture of transparency.
We should take a leaf out of their book throughout the European Union.
In fact, why should we deny the people the widest possible access to our files and documents?
What actually prevents us from widening this right and also giving it to Parliament's rapporteurs and others?
Why can the Council not work just as openly as the European Parliament to a large extent does?
Why do Council and Commission representatives have their own fixed seat in our committees, while Parliament does not in theirs, nor even its rapporteurs?
But more transparency is not enough in itself if we want to come closer to the citizens.
In addition to making political procedures and decision-making processes transparent, we must give the citizens a say.
The European Union institutions must develop mechanisms to enable the citizens to bring their own ideas and thoughts into the decision-making process.
That is a basic requirement of democracy.
If we are to build the Europe of the future, we need the participation of all concerned, not least for the sake of our credibility.
