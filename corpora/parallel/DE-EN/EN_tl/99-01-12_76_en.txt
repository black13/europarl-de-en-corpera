Mr President, this report concerns a most important aspect of the European Union's constitution; if its proposals become reality, the European Union will become far more parliamentary and therefore also democratic in nature.
We must remember that for a very long time EU policy was purely a matter for governments.
Now the European Union is gradually moving closer towards fulfilling certain of the criteria of a parliamentary democracy, a most important and positive move.
I believe it is very important that this also gives considerably more political weight to the elections to the European Parliament.
If the people's representation within the European Union now acquires the right to have a determining say in the appointments to the highest offices of the executive of the European Union, it will also acquire considerably greater influence on Commission policy.
I believe it is most important to follow on with the next step now and to enshrine in the political order of the EU the accountability of the Commission and its individual members to Parliament.
After all, we have discovered the need for that very clearly in the current debates.
The basic idea is surely as follows: we want a strong European Union, a Union that can also assert itself vis-Ã -vis national interests.
But a European Union that has this kind of power and influence needs a twin brother or sister.
Its name is democracy.
This report shows us that we can progress along this road to a democratic European Union in a crucial area, if the proposals it makes are implemented.
