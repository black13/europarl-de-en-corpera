Mr President, I broadly agree with this report, apart from one central point with which I do not agree, namely the attempt to link the nomination of the Commission President to the elections to the European Parliament, as Mr Delors had also once proposed.
I do not agree with it because the institutional consequences of this proposal have not been thought through and because it makes the dilemma of our method of integration quite glaringly obvious.
The President-in-Office of the Council praised the Jean Monnet method today, the pragmatism of integration policy.
That was the method of discreet projects that cleared the way and created momentum.
I believe the situation today is quite different, which is why I am extremely pleased that the President-in-Office has now for the first time announced the need for a constitutional process.
For the pragmatic method will certainly not take us forward any more.
What is the point of this kind of election of a President of the Commission if it is not a real election?
How can a parliament downgrade its own election into the quasi-election of an executive?
Where does this quasi-election of the Commission President take us?
Towards a presidential democracy?
Towards a federal system?
Or does the President of the Commission have to be a Member of Parliament, and, if so, why?
On the basis of what kind of constitutional vision?
I think the time has passed for trying to turn the accumulation of power that is the EU into a democracy by means of those kinds of pragmatic, individual advances.
The only way to turn this Union into a democracy now is through a constitutional process.
