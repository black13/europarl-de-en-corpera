Mr President, the rapporteur has taken on a difficult legacy with this report.
But he has successfully got it through committee with very skilful compromise amendments.
He is to be congratulated on that, even if he is not present.
In connection with this report, and besides the qualifications and criticisms Mr Voggenhuber has already made, I would like to raise another subject that is not considered in the report itself and cannot indeed be considered given the Treaties as they stand.
I have repeatedly pointed out that I regard the nomination of Commissioners by the Member States as an inherent mistake in the EU's institutional system.
It inevitably gives rise to conflicts between what the citizens of the nominating Member State expect of their Commissioner and the latter's obligation to give priority to EU interests.
I think this is at least partly responsible for the current difficulties and believe that this aspect also needs to be considered during the discussions on reforming the institutions.
