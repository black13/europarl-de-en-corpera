Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, during this unusual week the European Parliament is taking a twofold position on its executive.
Firstly, we are deciding on the destructive vote of censure - as it is called - against the Commission, and secondly we are establishing how our rights of assent can be used constructively in relation to future Commissions.
It is a question of becoming stronger as a parliament.
That is the main message of the Amsterdam Treaty.
But a stronger parliament also implies equal legislative rights, full budgetary rights and the right both to elect and to control the executive.
We have concrete demands to make in that respect.
The new President of the Commission must be voted in by the European Parliament, so the candidate must not be nominated before the elections.
Furthermore, for the future I hope that the main political parties will fight the campaign for the election of the European Parliament with a supranational top candidate who also aspires to the office of President of the Commission.
A substantial number of MEPs should form part of the college of Commissioners.
Today, as we know, there are seven already.
The proportion of women, currently 25 %, needs to be increased.
Moreover, the composition of the Commission should reflect the spectrum of political tendencies that make up the European constitutional consensus.
Last but not least, the individual members should also be held politically accountable in person for their sphere of responsibility.
During the 1994 appointment of the Commission, the European Parliament demonstrated that it was exercising its rights in regard both to hearings of individuals and to the vote to approve the college as a whole.
Much has happened since then.
The new relations between the European Parliament and the Commission must also be based on a code of conduct and on interinstitutional agreements.
The Brok report reflects our growing self-confidence and our common responsibility for the European Union.
