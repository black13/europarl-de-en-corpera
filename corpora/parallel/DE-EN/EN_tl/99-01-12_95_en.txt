Mr President, in the discussion about the European capital of culture all the participants seem to have forgotten that in the final analysis it is a question of culture.
It is surely a question of whether the city that is awarded the honorary title of European capital of culture can indeed live up to that title.
The Council is hiding behind formal arguments and provisions that seem to allow for no other options.
The report submitted here is based on substantive arguments that we do not find in the Council's statements.
In procedural terms the Council may be right, but that does not produce the best solutions.
Since in the final analysis it is a question of culture and therefore of Europe's reputation, all those involved should agree a procedure that guarantees the right choice of capital of culture.
