Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the wake of important events, it seems that everyone wants to have their say on agriculture today.
So I would just like to comment briefly on the Graefe zu Baringdorf report, specifically on direct payments and reductions.
I think it is right that European agriculture needs more long-term stable conditions, but it also needs to become more competitive so that, as well as producing foodstuffs, it can also, in accordance with the European agricultural model, cope with the additional major tasks facing the whole of society, such as preserving the agricultural landscape or generally protecting the environment.
The Commission proposals are logical.
Changes made in one area are balanced by changes in another.
But they are also very blunt.
For example, not enough attention is given to the situation of individual holdings.
Compensatory payments, introduced in the 1992 reform, are almost always really only partial compensation for losses incurred by farmers in the past and still today as a result of price reductions.
They are necessary if we are to be able to maintain extensive farming.
Good farming practice should be a prerequisite here.
However, high payments are often made in the case of farms that have substantial land or a high number of livestock, and these often attract criticism.
I think that reductions are necessary for this reason.
Large-scale holdings find it easier to cut costs than smaller family-run farms.
Reductions are necessary in order to allow the situation to become reasonably fair for family-run farms.
The question is how to we are to carry out these reductions.
