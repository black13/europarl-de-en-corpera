Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the belief that persistence will get us there in the end, we hope that the discussion today will achieve something.
The farming families of Europe need a reliable political framework.
The 1992 reform introduced direct payments for farmers as a result of a price reduction.
Commissioner, the criteria for direct payments are explained only in vague terms by the Commission and are even left to the discretion of the individual Member States.
But what we need in this area is equal treatment for all agricultural holdings in Europe.
The level of the direct payments to be made to farmers and the additional conditions to be imposed must not be decided at national level.
This is the only way in the end to ensure that market and competition distortions are avoided.
Farmers must be given a regular sum on which they can rely, and they must also be able to plan economically and successfully.
The Commission recognises the need to adjust to the world market.
This would expose European agriculture to worldwide competition, but it would at the same time be burdened by additional costs resulting from Europe's high environmental and social standards.
But how can we be competitive if conditions are so varied worldwide?
Direct payments to agriculture must in my view be considered from the point of view of less favourable natural production conditions.
We must not forget that farming families look after and preserve the agricultural landscape.
I would urge the Commission to use the given criteria as a basis for deciding on any further requirements to be imposed on agricultural production.
We must in future regard the principle of good farming practice as our starting point, a principle addressed by both Mrs Schierhuber and Mr Mayer.
We must establish a framework for European agriculture in which Europe's farmers can in future also survive on the world market.
