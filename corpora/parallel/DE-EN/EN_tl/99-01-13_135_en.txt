Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to concentrate mainly on two areas: milk and beef.
With regard to milk and the report by Mr Goepel, which in itself I would like to support fully, I regret that some of the amendments did not meet with approval in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
Examples include the important alternative proposals concerning price support and income support for milk producers, particularly in the disadvantaged mountain areas.
These must be given greater consideration and distortions of competition must be avoided or offset.
It is also essential to introduce measures to promote the consumption of milk and milk products, and the necessary funds must be provided for marketing.
I would advocate that the individual reference quantity for milk be divided by the number that corresponds to the average milk yield of the region.
This would be a fairer method for the mountain areas.
Finally, in my opinion the Member States should be paid in accordance with objective criteria, taking particular account of their respective production structures, especially in the mountain areas, so that they are not so dependent on variations in the market.
Fourthly, I also consider publicly-financed transportation aid to be absolutely necessary and indispensable.
As far as the beef situation is concerned, greater consideration should be given to the disadvantaged areas, for example in terms of eligibility for premiums.
Accordingly, young farmers should receive further additional financial support.
Action needs to be taken in this regard, as Commissioner Fischler said earlier today.
I hope that the Commission, in particular the very skilled and able Commissioner Fischler, who comes from a mountain area and knows the situation extremely well, and the Council will give my objections the appropriate consideration.
