Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office, I would like to say briefly that the Social Democrats in the European Parliament are very pleased that you have clarified these matters for us and that common sense has prevailed.
Of course snow falls in the beautiful Tyrol, in the almost as beautiful Allg√§u and also in beautiful Lower Saxony, and then the cows just have to be brought into their stalls.
All this - you know that I defend the Commission and also the Council on all important issues - fell victim to propaganda in my home town during the election.
It was said that ropes were banned from cowsheds, so of course people moaned about the nasty Eurocrats again.
I am pleased that this subject is now closed and that common sense has prevailed in Europe.
Thank you.
We can now at long last continue to support a very reasonable method of production.
