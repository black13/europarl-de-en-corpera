Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will help to save us some time.
I think we can say that the EU Agriculture Council has essentially succeeded in dealing with the new EU eco-regulation.
In our opinion the Federal Government has found acceptable compromises, particularly from a national point of view, in order to achieve vital objectives relating to livestock farming, feedingstuffs and veterinary medicine.
I consider this intermediate step to be an initial reaction.
An acceptable basis has been found for sustainable basic conditions for improved ecological livestock production.
Several speakers considered this to be long overdue.
It is now possible to conclude the amendment of the EU eco-regulation under the German Presidency in the first half of 1999.
I have another question concerning the quality mark.
But perhaps I am simply not well enough informed.
Are we again to have all the different national quality marks and an additional quality mark that can be recognised EU-wide, as Mr Mulder requested before in his report?
I think it would be helpful to have an answer from you on this issue.
But perhaps it is already in the text.
Will there be different national quality marks or a harmonised EU quality mark?
