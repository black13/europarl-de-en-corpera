Mrs Sch√∂rling, I fully understand your concern, and I can assure you that the Council takes this seriously.
However, the discussions which you mentioned have not been concluded and, therefore, the outcome you indicated is not the case either.
If the Council were to achieve an outcome, everything necessary would of course be done to safeguard the rights of Parliament, but also of course to give the Member States the opportunity - which they will also have during the discussions that take place beforehand - to explain their interpretation of the law, and to see to it that fundamental questions concerning the legal culture of the European Union are not adversely affected.
