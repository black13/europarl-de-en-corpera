Mr President, I am very grateful to you, Mr Elliot, for asking this question because it gives me the opportunity to clarify a point.
A date has not been fixed for the accessions.
Neither a later nor an earlier date has been indicated, but rather the date fixed will depend solely on how the negotiations progress.
As you know, there are altogether 31 packages for negotiation.
You are aware of the current situation.
Three of the 31 negotiation packages have been concluded provisionally, and four more are about to be concluded.
We intend to start negotiations on six to eight more packages during the German Presidency, so that about half of all the packages are in the process of being negotiated by mid-1999.
By then we will have perhaps almost reached the stage where we can see how much longer we actually need.
We will then have to decide whether or not to fix a date for the accessions.
I do not see the danger you seem to in the effect that institutional reform would have on enlargement.
According to the consensus we have established within the Member States, the institutional problems should be resolved by the year 2001.
However, I would see this as the latest date for this.
It is highly unlikely that an accession treaty can be agreed upon and concluded with any one applicant country by 2001.
To answer this question very precisely, I do not believe that we will be in a position where the negotiations on accession have been concluded, but the European Union is not ready for enlargement because the institutional issues have not been resolved.
This matter is of the utmost importance for the German Presidency, and I am grateful to see that this is also an extremely important issue for Parliament.
I firmly believe that the credibility of the entire enlargement process also depends on how seriously we work towards completing the institutional reforms.
