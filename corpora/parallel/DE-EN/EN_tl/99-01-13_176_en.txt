Mr President, a few days ago Mr von Wogau's press officer was attacked at Place Schuman at 7 o'clock in the evening.
He was taken to hospital with a cut.
However, this is by no means an isolated case.
In the last year, Mr Voggenhuber, Mrs McCarthy, Mr Schiedermeier, Mrs Pack and many others have been attacked in Brussels.
My office carried out a survey of 300 offices in the European Parliament; over a third of them reported an incidence of criminal assault in Brussels within the last year.
I believe that the European institutions need to be made safer.
The Belgian national parliament is kept under surveillance by the army and the police force.
As far as I know, the European institutions are not kept under surveillance at all.
There are more than 10 reported cases of theft on average each month in the European Parliament alone.
How does the Council presidency intend to improve this situation?
