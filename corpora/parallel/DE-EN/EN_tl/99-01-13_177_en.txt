Mr RÃ¼big, you will understand why I have to point out firstly that maintaining public law and order on the territory of the Member States is primarily a matter for the police forces of the individual states.
Having said this, the facts which you described are to be taken seriously, and I will use this as an opportunity to address the issue at an appropriate time.
