Mr President, Mr Blak, I am grateful to you for your kind words of acknowledgement, though I must add that we do not deserve them.
The praise should go to the Austrian Presidency, because the decision which I referred to comes from the communiqu√© of the Vienna summit.
It was agreed in Vienna.
The European Council has asked the Commission to present a report on this by March 1999; this is therefore not very far away, and it will of course be the presidency's task to ensure that the deadline set by the Council is observed.
I can promise you that we will not wait until the end of the year before asking whether the report is on its way and when it will be made available.
