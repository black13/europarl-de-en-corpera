Mr President, Mrs Moreau, as you can imagine, the opinion of Mr Schr√∂der, the President of the Council, is well known to me.
Your information is indeed correct.
However, I am still not in a position to report any conclusions; the Council cannot of course draw conclusions until the reports it commissioned are actually available.
I would ask for your understanding in this matter, but once again I specifically refer to the last phrase in the Council decision I quoted, which mentions that the possibility of extending the transitional provisions for a limited period is also to be reviewed.
