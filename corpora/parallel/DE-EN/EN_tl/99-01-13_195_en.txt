Mr President, Mr Watts, I understood the question in both languages.
I am assuming that the Commission and the ECOFIN Council will naturally be using all relevant sources as a basis for carrying out the task which they have been given.
I believe the sources you mentioned are relevant and should therefore be taken into account when collecting data and estimates which are really important for this.
You will understand that in my present capacity I cannot and may not comment on the political opinion of a Member State's Head of Government.
However, I can of course assure you that conclusions from the reports which have been commissioned will not be drawn until the reports are made available, and that no conclusion is excluded for the moment; neither, therefore, is the one to which you referred.
