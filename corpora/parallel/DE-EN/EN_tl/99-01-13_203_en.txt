Mr Martin has hit upon the presidency's intentions completely with the suggestion he made in his question.
We consider it to be quite an important matter.
Our concern over the continuing human rights abuses in Burma is so great that I am able to add that the situation will be discussed further among the Foreign Ministers.
We will also have other opportunities to discuss this issue during our presidency, and also with the countries in the region.
The aim of promoting the European Union's clear position on human rights and human rights issues in the area of international relations and wherever possible, to not only convey our concern regarding human rights issues, but also to take action to remedy the situation, is an absolute priority for our presidency.
