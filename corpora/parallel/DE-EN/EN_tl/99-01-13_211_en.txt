I can assure Mr Hyland that I fully understand his question, because I, as a Member of Parliament myself, come from such an area and see the problems at first hand everyday.
I can therefore say in principle that the task of maintaining sustainable rural areas is a matter of priority for the Council.
We must really make sure that the people in rural areas have the chance of a future.
This future need not necessarily be in the traditional areas of agriculture.
Opportunities for the future can of course also be created through structural change, as you know very well.
I firmly believe that we will manage to target European Union funds in the area of regional and structural policy even more efficiently on this objective, not least within the framework of the reforms which are being carried out under Agenda 2000.
This is a really important objective of the Union's regional and structural policy, in the opinion of the presidency at least.
It not only involves making standards of living more equal, but it means that important agricultural landscapes in the rural areas of Europe will continue to offer people quality of life and job prospects in the future as well.
