Mr Crowley, I agree with you that this is a very important issue.
I can therefore assure you that the presidency is convinced that it will be possible, on the basis of the forthcoming reform of the agricultural policy and as a result of the new impetus which the rural development policy will be given, to develop a second pillar of the common agricultural policy; this second pillar will then be the foundation for a comprehensive and coherent policy for the benefit of the rural population in the European Union.
In order to achieve this, it will actually be necessary to achieve greater coordination between the different policy areas and also to establish clear priorities.
However, I must ask you to appreciate that we cannot be more precise about this until Agenda 2000 has been concluded and we have started to implement its objectives.
