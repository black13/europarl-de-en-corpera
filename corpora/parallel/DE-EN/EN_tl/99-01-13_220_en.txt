Mr Gallagher, I am very grateful to you for the advice and information you have offered, and we will naturally take it into account during the current accession negotiations.
Also, your country, Ireland, is participating in the accession conference and has every possibility to raise the national and supranational viewpoints you have described during the negotiations.
I also firmly believe that this will be done.
However, I am not in a position at present to tell you anything about the implementation of the redefinition of assisted areas, or the criteria which affect assisted areas, as the decision of general principle has not yet been taken.
The individual Member States have obviously established their own positions.
However, as you already know, the Council has not yet stated its common position with regard to Agenda 2000.
I would therefore have to rely on assumptions at the present time, and making assumptions unfortunately serves no purpose in this case.
We must continue to be patient and wait until Agenda 2000 can be concluded.
However, it might be important for you to know that the presidency has agreed to exchange information and cooperate closely with Parliament on a particularly intensive and regular basis during the current decision process.
