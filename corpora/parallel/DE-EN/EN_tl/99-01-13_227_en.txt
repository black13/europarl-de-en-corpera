This is a very difficult issue.
Mr Crowley, you know of course that a special summit of Heads of State and Government on the subject of organised crime is planned for the second half of this year under the Finnish Presidency, and that the issues you mentioned in connection with the fight against drugs will also play a central role in the preparation for this special summit.
However, in cooperation with the Finnish Presidency we will do our bit so that the preparatory work for this is under way and so that the decisions we are currently in a position to make can be made at this special summit.
This limitation relates to the fact that we can obviously only make decisions which are in keeping with our capabilities, our resources, our instruments, and our institutions.
The presidency wholly shares the political assessment on which your question was based.
We consider the fight against drug abuse to be a key task of domestic policy in Western countries, and indeed in all countries.
It is naturally also a joint task which we should tackle - as far as possible - within the framework of the European Union.
