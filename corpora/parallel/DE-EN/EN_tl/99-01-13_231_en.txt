Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, I am sorry that you are so unhappy with my answer.
However, I would ask you to understand that I must report the positions which are supported by 15 countries.
Surely you realise as well as I do that one of the Union's problems is that we do not have a common foreign and security policy in the stricter sense.
Answers such as that which I have just given you are the result of this situation.
Such an answer does not reflect the capabilities or intentions of the presidency; it reflects the state of affairs in the European Union in the area of foreign and security policy.
I assume that you see this in exactly the same way as I do.
The presidency is obviously not in a position to change internal relations in Algeria.
It is merely in a position to exert an influence - by continuing the intensive political dialogue which has already been started with Algeria - on the improvement of relations with regard to democracy, human rights, rule of law, and fair social development.
I can assure you that the German Presidency will work towards this in this dialogue.
