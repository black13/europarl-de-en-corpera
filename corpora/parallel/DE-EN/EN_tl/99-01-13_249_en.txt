Mr President, Mr Garosci's report has my full backing.
Serious distortions of competition arise because of the differences in the way Member States treat tourism companies in respect of the right to deduct value added tax.
This affects 'business tourism' - in other words, conferences and congresses - as well as private business travel.
As the rapporteur says, business travel accounts for approximately 20 % of total turnover in the tourism sector.
Expenditure per guest is by far the highest, since many overseas visitors - especially from North America and Japan - attend these business events.
Competition between the various congress and conference locations is consequently extremely tough.
Business tourism deserves our support as a valuable source of jobs.
Hence the particular importance of Amendment No 7, which advocates full deduction of expenditure on accommodation and food or drink, as well as on entertaining business partners.
