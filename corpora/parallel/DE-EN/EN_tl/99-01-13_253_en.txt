Mr President, Commissioner Bangemann, ladies and gentlemen, in principle I welcome the proposed changes in the deduction and refund system for VAT.
These procedures are particularly cumbersome in certain Member States; we repeatedly see the adverse effect on businesses of the time and costs involved.
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy is therefore expressly in favour of simplifying the procedures.
We would even go a step further in some areas.
Accommodation and food or drink expenses incurred as part of a person's business activities should, we believe, remain fully deductible.
It is hard to see why money spent in hotels and restaurants for purely business purposes should be treated differently from any other business expenditure.
The business lunch or dinner is valuable when it comes to fostering contacts and building up client confidence - especially for small companies, who can also use the occasion to present their products.
In Austria, we have found that reducing the tax deductibility of business entertainment can harm the gourmet restaurant sector.
We therefore believe that Parliament's amendment offers an appropriate way of resolving this problem.
We also have a proposal on translation costs.
Tax administrations are quite entitled to ask for the details on an invoice or whatever to be translated.
We do know, however, that this can cause difficulties for SMEs, who often do not have the necessary language expertise to hand.
Some countries even require officially certified translations; this can mean bringing in a 'sworn' translator or court-recognised interpreter.
Consequently, it would make sense for the costs of external translation to be borne by the requesting administration.
I am delighted to see that the Commission's commitment to a leaner and fitter regulatory system at single market level is now bearing fruit in the VAT sector too.
