Mr President, an Internet Charter makes very good sense.
We are confronted daily with new communications technologies; these are penetrating ever deeper into all areas of our lives.
Care must be taken with regard to competition law, however.
We do not want to see it undermined.
Globalisation and the information society influence not only industrial and cultural policy; the impact on human rights is considerable too.
I am disappointed, therefore, to see that combating Internet crime is accorded such marginal treatment.
The Internet is being misused for the purposes of spreading child pornography; child abuse is happening online; and trafficking in children is even being organised over the net.
Society has a massive problem here.
The European Union should be giving its full attention to this baser side of globalisation.
Greater international cooperation between administrative authorities and more financial resources are called for.
