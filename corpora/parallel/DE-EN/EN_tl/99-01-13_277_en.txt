Mr President, Commissioner Monti, ladies and gentlemen, the notion of commercial communications might initially seem a rather abstract one.
Thanks to the Commission's Green Paper and Mrs Larive's report, however, we can appreciate the true range of the subject.
At issue are all forms of communication where suppliers - in order to enhance their product's image or promote sales - set about targeting consumers.
The scope is that wide.
The term commercial communications therefore covers advertising, direct marketing and sponsorship, as well as sales promotion and - significantly - public relations.
The sector already provides over a million jobs, and that figure is constantly increasing.
More importantly, we are dealing with a market of the future, which will eventually employ even greater numbers in other areas.
Since the single market will have a special role to play here, we need to ensure that its completion in this sector is speeded up.
To my mind, the section in the report on mutual recognition is therefore of paramount importance.
One of the cornerstones of a common market is that once an activity has been authorised in one Member State, transfrontier communication must be permitted.
This brings to mind the directive on buses, as dealt with by Mr Murphy in his celebrated report.
Buses are not our topic today, but we did give priority to the principle of mutual recognition when considering that report.
Let us then hope that the Commission and the Council will rise to the challenge when pursuing their legislative agenda.
