Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, may I begin by saying a few words to the last speaker.
I would point out to Mr Simpson that he was speaking there on behalf of the Socialist Group, not of Parliament.
Here we are again, sitting late into the night and having to acknowledge once more that the Commission has problems getting the timing right when it comes to directives.
This is not the first sitting at which the Commission has had to be asked how much headway has been made.
A fresh proposal for a directive was supposed to have been submitted by the end of 1998.
That deadline has been allowed to pass.
As I have stated on several occasions in the past, Commissioner, you cannot expect the legislative process to run smoothly unless you meet the timetables.
You have forfeited the chance to produce long-overdue proposals on enhancing the quality of the EU's postal services.
With proper competition, costs could be brought down and the system made capable of matching alternatives such as fax or e-mail.
If you did not act for fear of the left-wing majority in the Council, then I have little sympathy.
If you failed to deliver because you are not happy with the way the Member States are transposing the directive, then that means that the Commission has not fulfilled its duty as guardian of the treaties.
And whilst on this topic, I note with interest the provenance of the three questioners; their countries seem to have a particular problem with transposing this directive, although it has been officially adopted.
I would therefore appeal to you, Mr Bangemann, to come back to Parliament as soon as possible with a committed proposal for a further directive.
The old one called for an intelligent approach to the development of our postal services, and I trust that this will be forthcoming in the near future.
