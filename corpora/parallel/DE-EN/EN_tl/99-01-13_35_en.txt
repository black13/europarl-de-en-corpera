Madam President, I should just like to point out that this is not something which Mr Rehder - who may have been underestimated - has made up.
I invite you to go and see the President of the European Court of Auditors; he can show you the figures.
The fact is that you cannot simply denounce things which do not suit you.
That is a remedy which inflicts further damage on small farmers.
Mr Friedmann will explain it to you quite calmly, even if you still do not believe Mr Rehder, whom you have surely underestimated.
