Madam President, one of the intentions of CAP reform is to reduce support prices to bring them into line with the world market, in order to comply with international agreements.
The compensatory payments to farmers do not, however, cover the resulting loss of income, and thus endanger the farming community.
The Commission proposals are geared towards the world market.
The European farming industry is, however, very diverse and structured in smaller units than is the case in the United States, for example; it is hard to make a direct comparison.
Even US experts warned that full-blown liberalisation would threaten international agricultural commodities markets with the same fate as that of US farmers - a loss of income of 16 % - and advocated market stabilisation measures.
Quantity management must continue to form part of the market organisations.
We need farmers who maintain the ecological balance and care for the countryside.
Linking compensatory payments to environmental requirements is desirable and important, but for this to be fair, it has to be done on the basis of uniform European environmental standards.
This reform package would continue to sound the death knell for farmers.
It is not acceptable in its present form.
