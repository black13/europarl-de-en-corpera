Mr President, I am of course in favour of the agreement with Latvia and I am also in favour of Latvia's inclusion in and accession to the European Union as soon as possible.
However, I must say that, although I agree with the Sepp√§nen report, I have considerable problems with its explanatory statement as it is an accurate representation of the Russian nationalist point of view in this context.
It describes NATO membership for Latvia as dangerous and points to the problematic issue of Russian minorities.
But it does not mention that this problem is a consequence of the fact that, contrary to the provisions of international law, Latvia was occupied for decades and subjected to a systematic settlement policy, and that the country was therefore settled by occupation in violation of international law.
Attempts are now being made to use this problem, which undoubtedly needs to be solved sensitively, as an excuse for possibly calling Latvia's independence into question.
Therefore, I believe that Latvian membership of NATO would not aggravate this problem but would alleviate it.
If Latvia knows that its freedom and independence are no longer under threat it will also deal with its minority problems in a more relaxed manner.
