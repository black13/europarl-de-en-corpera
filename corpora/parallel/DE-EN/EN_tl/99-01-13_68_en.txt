Mr President, I abstained from the vote on the Brok report, not because I do not agree with most of his proposals; of course I do!
Indeed, this week I am more strongly than ever in favour of Parliament having a stronger influence over the Commission.
We must ensure that Parliament is no longer the Commission's slave but that instead the Commission - which must of course also be strong, but supported by Parliament - is monitored by a strong Parliament.
This week we have seen the disaster that has occurred as a result of this not being the case hitherto.
I am in favour of the strictest measures in the current crisis, perhaps going as far as a motion of censure.
But there is one thing that I do not agree with: the proposal to have an elected President of the European Commission.
I could perhaps have accepted this in the Social Democrats' more moderate version but not in the form in which it has now been adopted, because in my opinion an election of this kind is not appropriate for a multinational structure such as the EU and could easily lead to national or nationality-related problems.
In my view, the Commission and the Commission President must be determined by Parliament, but I do not believe in this kind of EU-wide presidential election.
