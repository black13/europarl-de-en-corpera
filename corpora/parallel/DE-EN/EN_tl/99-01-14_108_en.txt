Mr President, I would first like to support the rapporteur's critical remarks about the timing of this debate, which is being held in the presence of representatives of a Council presidency just a few days old.
Our job is to assess the work done by the British and Austrian Presidencies.
Both initially presented a realistic programme and announced improvements in cooperation with Parliament.
In practice, however, things turned out somewhat differently.
Neither the spirit nor the letter of the promises made to us has been honoured.
Many of the decisions foreshadowed have been deferred, and in a number of areas unsatisfactory compromises have been reached.
The most striking example of the European Union's laborious progress is probably the slow start that Europol has got off to.
I would like to make one more point.
Paragraph 1(2) of the version of the Van Lancker report that I have before me seems to suggest that the Treaty of Amsterdam came into force a year ago - this must be one of those pre-cessions the President-in-Office was talking about this morning!
