Mr President, Madam Commissioner, we all agree that the Schengen security system is quite simply essential if we are to achieve freedom of movement.
We should never forget that we can only enjoy freedom of movement if we continue to guarantee security for all our citizens, and if possible even increase it.
The facts demonstrate just how important the Schengen security system really is.
I requested some figures which show that there are approximately 30 000 successful searches made each year, totalling around 120 000 searches by the end of 1998.
That means that tonnes of drugs have been seized, thousands of stolen cars have been identified at the borders, weapons and stolen works of art have been seized, and thousands of illegal immigrant smugglers have been arrested, or, in the case of illegal immigrants, intercepted at the border.
So Schengen has led to an improvement in security.
This is also proof that the Schengen security system, as already implemented by 10 Member States, is sound.
I would go so far as to say that it is unique in the world, with 6 million data records on missing persons and stolen property, and controls at over 1 500 border crossing points.
So what further progress can we expect?
I see the emphasis as being on three focal points, which I would like to single out.
First, now that we have seen how well Schengen can function, and how important it is for achieving freedom of movement, we should implement the Schengen Agreement in all our Member States and thus improve security for all Europe's citizens.
Second, we should offer more support to those Member States faced with tougher challenges, particularly in connection with migration, by means of help with border controls and also help with burden sharing.
Third, we should use the Pre-Accession Pact as a means of offering support to the applicant countries, as accession to the European Union is only possible if the security standards are met.
