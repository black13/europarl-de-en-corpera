Mr President, I believe this resolution dwells rather too much on past events and does not focus on the fact that a new danger is looming.
It is perfectly clear that the provocations are starting again, that the actions by the Iraqi side, or rather Saddam Hussein's side, are continuing, with the result that there is a serious risk of war on the horizon.
Saddam Hussein does what he wants, showing utter contempt for everyone.
The very fact that he has spurned the 'food for oil' programme is itself clear proof that he does whatever he pleases with the Iraqi people.
One simple fact should not be forgotten: this man comes from the town of Tikrit and is only interested in the Tikrit tribe; all others are only slaves who are used as cannon fodder.
Saddam Hussein is essentially an Arab version of what Hitler was in our part of the world.
He has exactly the same personality profile and pursues exactly the same type of policy, which is why there will be no peace until he has been replaced, until a different government is at the helm.
Actions that signal a real will to replace him are therefore entirely justified.
That is why I have been critical of the air strikes, which are a futile gesture.
Missiles were fired, the people were terrified, but Saddam Hussein was not harmed; on the contrary, the air strikes gave him an opportunity to strengthen his position still further and aroused worldwide suspicion that the purpose of the whole escapade was to divert attention from certain embarrassing events in the United States.
I even saw in one of our newspapers that they were calling the missiles 'Monica'.
We should perhaps bring out that point more clearly in the resolution, or at least in the discussion on the resolution.
For that reason, if the House adopts the resolution, which is a good one, it should reject the three amendments, the only real purpose of which is to undermine and water down this resolution.
That is important if we want to send a clear message.
