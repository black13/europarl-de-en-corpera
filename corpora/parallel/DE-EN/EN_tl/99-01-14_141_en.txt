Mr President, I can be brief.
Mr Habsburg more or less implied that we were not credible.
What I said was the result of a report compiled by a delegation of the European Parliament that had just visited Huambo in Angola.
We observed time and again that UNITA had violated the peace agreement and had taken up arms again.
I believe the basis must be the Lusaka peace agreement, and we as a Parliament should insist that it be upheld.
It is the basis of a future peace, and we must demand compliance.
That is a credible approach.
To that extent we have a responsibility here, and we want to ensure that the agreement is respected.
