Mr President, I believe we all want peace in the Western Sahara, and for that reason we probably all support the purpose of this resolution.
I must say, however, that I personally would have preferred this parliamentary resolution to be tabled after the Security Council resolution.
But let me say that it is surely not enough for everyone to point the finger at Morocco and to blame that country for all the delays.
We should perhaps correct certain fallacies that have even gained currency here in Europe.
If we talk about the people who are entitled to vote in the referendum, we cannot simply exclude those who have been living in what is now the Western Sahara for a good deal more than ten years and who have effectively earned their right of residence.
After all, there is also a great deal of discussion today in the various Member States of the European Union about the specific rights that people acquire by living in our countries for a certain length of time.
These people cannot simply be excluded from a referendum; similarly, those who are living in the refugee camps in Algeria must also be enfranchised.
But allow me to add a very brief historical footnote, since there is so much talk here about colonialisation, recolonialisation and so on.
The territory of the Western Sahara belonged to Morocco for many centuries before it came into Spanish possession.
I could not let that go unsaid.
