Mr President, trafficking in children in Guatemala is a lucrative business.
A veritable Mafia kidnaps children, persuades poverty-stricken women to hand over their children, forges birth certificates and sells the children abroad.
Even a notary public has the power to authorise adoptions.
Prices of 15 000 to 20 000 dollars per child are not unusual.
Under the Guatemalan penal code, trafficking in children is not a crime and does not carry a penalty.
All the countries in the region have amended their laws in recent years in order to eliminate this inhuman and exploitative practice, but Guatemala has not yet taken that step.
It is now high time it did.
Guatemala must also proceed without delay to ratify the Hague Convention on Inter-Country Adoption and must meet its obligations under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child by promulgating its Juvenile and Adolescent Code.
Adoptions are sometimes a valid last resort, but the child should remain as close as possible to its cultural and geographical roots.
Adoptions, however, can never be a contribution to development aid, because development aid means creating the conditions in which children can grow up in their own countries.
I urge everyone to bear that in mind.
