Mr President, there can be no peace without human rights.
We had numerous first-hand experiences of that when our delegation visited Colombia in December.
The murders - well over a hundred in number - committed by the paramilitaries have been another horrific reminder of the truth of that proposition.
The paramilitaries are not parties to peace talks.
The paramilitaries are criminal gangs that must be dissolved immediately.
Their members and their paymasters must be brought to justice, and all their helpers in the administration and the armed forces must be summarily dismissed.
Not until the right to life is guaranteed in Colombia will there be hope of real peace.
This means that the warring factions must immediately start to apply the fundamental principles of humanitarianism.
It means that the government must act to protect the victims of the conflict, including more than a million refugees, many of whom are blacks and Indios.
No more impunity for lawbreakers!
Reform the administration of justice, particularly the system of military jurisdiction.
Agrarian reform has to be implemented, and economic and social justice must be established.
This is a task for the European Union too.
We should be helping here, instead of competing for pole position in the export markets.
We must pay fair prices and promote regional development, because peace is the reward for completing this process, not the prerequisite for launching it.
