Mr President, I can only agree with the words of the previous speakers.
We do have to ask when this circle of violence, murder, kidnapping and hostage-taking will finally end, when the political authorities and the responsible democrats will finally be strong enough to silence the guns and stamp out corruption and drug trafficking.
The Pastrana government - and we congratulate them on this - are using the strength inherent in a new government to open negotiations with the strongest of the warring factions, with all the difficulties this involves.
We can but hope that negotiations with the other groups will follow, that the paramilitary groups as well as the guerrillas will stop the kidnapping, hostage-taking and killing and that the armed forces finally come to realise that their function is not only to defend the power of the state in a military sense, but also to defend democratic and humane practices.
In this respect, not only the armed forces but also, as has been said already, the constitutional State of Colombia - assuming it wishes to become one - certainly still have a very great deal to learn, and we must help them in that learning process.
It is degrading for a country when its name appears at the top of such a blacklist.
But it is even worse and even more horrific for its people.
We call on the Colombian Government to protect the defenders of human rights and shall support their efforts to do so.
We shall also support them in their quest for justice and peace.
During our visit to Bogota in December, we also spoke to the UN High Commissioner for Bogota, who has been an extremely courageous champion of human rights.
There was a question mark over the future of her post.
We very much hope that the office of High Commissioner, which is held in high esteem in Colombia, can be preserved, and I should like to ask the Commission whether it is doing everything in its power to ensure that the post will in fact be preserved.
