Mr President, we are dismayed and appalled that the civil war has broken out again in Sierra Leone.
We had hoped that a stable peace could be established between the government and the Revolutionary United Front once the President and the civil government were restored to office in March 1998.
We should do everything in our power to re-establish peace, and we call on both parties to agree a cease-fire without delay, to open negotiations - and I believe we must support these negotiations - to respect human rights fully and to recognise the international human rights conventions.
For the needy, who always bear the brunt of these conflicts, the provision of humanitarian aid is essential.
We want to ensure that famine does not develop in Sierra Leone and that the refugees in neighbouring countries are cared for, which means that there is a pressing need to conclude a cease-fire in the first instance.
