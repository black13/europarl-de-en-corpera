Madam President, I wanted to take up the suggestion made by the previous President of the sitting, Mr Martin.
There is no disagreement here between the Commission and the Council, or between the Council and Parliament.
I believe the Council should be present, because we parliamentarians have addressed remarks to the Council on several occasions, and it ought to know what we are saying.
If I may give the example of the Western Sahara, the Council's function with regard to humanitarian aid differs from that of the Commission, for example, and it must be aware of our views.
That is a political necessity.
I would therefore ask you, Madam President, to raise in the Bureau our wish as Members of Parliament that we should be holding a joint sitting on these matters, at which the Commission speaks but the Council is also aware of what is being said.
