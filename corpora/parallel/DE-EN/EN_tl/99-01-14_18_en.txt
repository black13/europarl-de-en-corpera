Mr President, my group cannot support Mr Nassauer's motion for a resolution.
We cannot accept the wording on Europol and on asylum and migration policy.
We are not opposed to Europol, quite the contrary, we are in favour of Europol and citizens' rights.
What is at stake is the legality of the work done by officials in the EU who are supposed to be dealing with citizens' security.
It seems that there is agreement on police cooperation, and on setting up Europol, but they are being denied the legal bases required for their work, in other words democratic legal bases guaranteed in the Member States.
We find that unacceptable.
The police need generally applicable laws in order to operate properly.
But that was not the subject of the decision - it was about the immunity of Europol officials.
Who are we protecting against whom?
We are protecting our officials against our own democratic laws and courts, but we are not protecting anyone else.
I am sorry that Mr Nassauer is not with us now.
He welcomed the Austrian Presidency's failed initiative against illegal immigration.
The fact that he also welcomes the campaign in my home Land of Hessen against dual nationality is his problem.
I would like to ask him if we agree on the definition of illegal immigration.
What does illegal mean in the EU?
Does it include people recognised as refugees in one Member State but rejected in another because it has different asylum laws?
There is indeed illegal immigration, from eastern Europe for example.
We are not defending the idea of open borders, and we are prepared to accept reasonable regulations and harmonisation.
However, this must not mean that human rights suffer as a consequence.
I am grateful for the current Council presidency's suggestion that we need a new summit, as explained by Mr Fischer, the German Minister for Foreign Affairs, and I hope that the German Presidency will succeed in making certain changes in this area.
