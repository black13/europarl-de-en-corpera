Madam President, the Philippines is a country that has a variety of ties with Europe, some of which, unfortunately, have certain adverse repercussions from a European point of view.
Foremost among these is sex tourism, the causes of which lie primarily in Europe.
What we are discussing here is a resolution on the peace process in the Philippines, the process of establishing peace between the government and the National Democratic Front.
This peace process should benefit the people and their country.
The potentially violent disputes must not be allowed to continue; efforts for peace, social and economic reforms and land reform must come to dominate the political landscape.
Human rights can only benefit from such efforts.
They are part of this process.
At least the people of the Philippines are well aware of the value of democracy.
They are also aware of the value of international humanitarian conventions.
There are many non-governmental organisations in the Philippines - social and church organisations - which care for people and promote peace.
I very much hope that the assistance provided by the European Union will also reach its target there too, for there is a need to mobilise all forces to assist in this complex process in a country which is, of course, already democratic, with a view to reconstructing peace and democracy.
We call on the government and the political parties to intensify their efforts, and we call on the European Union to support these efforts.
May I take this opportunity to say, Commissioner, that I am not sure whether I am entirely happy about your sudden solicitude for the Council.
We are not used to that here.
The point of the question I asked you before, and of many other questions besides, was to ascertain who has a say in the use of EU funds.
That was the point I raised.
