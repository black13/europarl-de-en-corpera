Madam President, the peace process in the Philippines has certainly been a lengthy process.
The European Union and Parliament, of course, have also made important contributions to the peace effort.
I can certainly recall visits by several delegations in the EC-ASEAN framework, for example in the early days of Mrs Aquino's government.
At that time we gave strong backing to the process.
There is goodwill on both sides - on the NDFP side and on the government side - as has been said.
We must support and encourage this goodwill.
It seems to me that there are two especially important points.
The first is the monitoring of human rights observance, and the second is the essential land reform.
This takes us back to the institutional conflict between the Commission and the Council.
I believe - and I should like to say this quite explicitly today, Mr Mar√≠n - that the Commission has done valuable and significant work with regard to the Philippines.
It is, of course, important that projects are implemented and that there is no possibility of projects being implemented in which human rights are infringed.
But that is a political issue.
The call for land reform is addressed to the Council.
That is why I shall close by repeating my request that you in the Bureau, as David Martin suggested before, should ask the Council to attend these debates, to hear these messages for itself and to organise this new practice jointly with ourselves.
