Madam President, the basic tenor of this report, which places the child at the centre of the European discussion, is to be very warmly welcomed.
And in very many details too, it strikes exactly the right note and addresses reality in a very frank and open manner.
I do not think the question of subsidiarity or competence arises here at all.
The family and the protection of children are naturally a matter for local authorities, municipal administrations and civic and charitable associations.
But the family is also a European and a global phenomenon, so why should European policymakers not concern themselves with the family, and why should there not be a special interest in the protection of children at European level?
It is necessary to break down the walls of silence, because there is far too much maltreatment of children in disturbed family environments.
Among the many proposals in this report, those that deal with the subject of child abuse are very important.
Where does the sexual abuse of children begin?
Probably in the family environment.
But a long time ago it began to assume a very global dimension, and what is happening on the Internet and in the domain of mass tourism may perhaps be termed the globalisation of perversion.
I should like to mention two more points that I consider very interesting and constructive, namely the call for a special meeting of the European Council devoted to child protection policy and the suggestion for the creation of a European centre for children, one of the principal tasks of which would be to compile and maintain a database on missing children and convicted child abductors, in cooperation with the national authorities and Europol.
