Mr President, although I cannot be here this afternoon, for which I hope you will forgive me, we will be able to continue this discussion in the relevant committees over the next week.
I would therefore like to pick up just two points which I consider especially important in this context and which need to be followed up.
The first is exchanges of information and relations between the Council, the Council presidency and the European Parliament.
It is evident from the comments made by honourable Members that there are genuine problems.
I would like to assure you that we will endeavour to work with you to solve these problems in a spirit of cooperation and in accordance with the European treaties.
The second point I would like to pick up is the transition from the Maastricht Treaty to the Treaty of Amsterdam.
I believe that we can expect an important debate on new ideas here - including the work done by the Commission - so that we can push ahead with our plans in the fields of internal security and the common European legal area, quickly and profitably.
