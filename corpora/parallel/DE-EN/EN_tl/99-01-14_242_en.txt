Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it will be no secret to the rapporteur that I harbour numerous doubts concerning the legality of the measures he proposes, of which, for reasons of time, I shall only be able to cite a few representative examples.
The cases you describe relate to glaring and despicable abuses.
We shall have to make every possible effort to scrutinise international law for ways and means of developing a code of conduct that will justify the conviction on moral grounds of the European firms which violate these principles of human rights.
On the other hand, we shall have to take care - and this is a point that has frequently come to my attention here in Parliament - to exercise our responsibility for keeping our reports within the legal bounds we have set for ourselves.
I strongly support the involvement of non-governmental organisations in the development of the existing guidelines for an international code of conduct, such as those followed by the OECD.
We must realise, however, that it is Utopian to call for a European legal framework governing EU-based companies with worldwide operations, and that such a framework would even be illegal because of its extraterritorial character.
We cannot condemn the Helms-Burton or D'Amato legislation for claiming extraterritorial jurisdiction, and then think that we can introduce the same sort of thing here.
The law is the law!
For that reason, I rather regret that there are four, five or six other cases which will be relevant to tomorrow's vote and which deviate from established legal standards.
For that reason, Mr Howitt, I should be glad if you would exercise some flexibility and tolerance at the vote in plenary tomorrow, otherwise I believe the form in which you wish to organise the vote will be unacceptable to many Members, at least to those in the European People's Party, even though you undoubtedly have a legitimate case.
