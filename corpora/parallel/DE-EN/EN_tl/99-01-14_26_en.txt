Mr President, we have made this request under Rule 119 because we assume that the vote on the motion of censure is the more significant one.
There is now an institutional conflict between the Parliament and the Commission, and I believe that we will not be able to explain it to our electorate if we start arguing about various individual positions and split Parliament into subtly differentiated factions, instead of adopting an unequivocal position towards the fraud, corruption and nepotism inside the Commission.
I think this House agrees that that is what this motion of censure is all about, and in that sense it is the most significant.
That is what we have to vote on.
We have requested a roll-call vote in this case because if it eventually comes out that Parliament did not act firmly in this institutional conflict, it will have made a poor start, a false start if you like, to the election campaign.
That is why I am requesting this vote.
