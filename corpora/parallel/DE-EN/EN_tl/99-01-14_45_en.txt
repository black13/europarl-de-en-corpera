Mr President, the theatrical performance that we have seen today may have been a perfectly normal and legitimate procedure in parliamentary terms, but from the point of view of our electors it was highly regrettable, as the Socialist Group has unanimously covered up for its discredited Commissioners, and that is the real scandal that we will have to come to terms with in the next few months.
A few votes one way or other on the motion of censure will not change that.
We shall continue to work towards transparency, propriety, democracy and stronger rights for Parliament, whether the Socialists like it or not.
