Mr President, the fact that the Commission - and this proves just how right my group was to vote for the motion of censure - said that it had behaved ineptly or that it had been the victim of its own transparency is neither here nor there.
It simply proves, once again, that the Commission is still incapable of grasping the political dimension.
The Commission has slipped back into a pre-democratic way of thinking.
It has proved incapable of behaving reasonably throughout this disastrous affair.
We were not just worried about nepotism and corruption.
We were also concerned that the Commission has recently become incapable of doing justice to the clear political remit entrusted to it.
It was obvious to us that this risks playing into the hands of those who want renationalisation.
Because we want a strong Europe and need a strong Commission, we had no option but to express our lack of confidence in this Commission.
We hope that the Commission has at last learnt the lesson that we are in a democracy and that it is time to end this pre-democratic mindset and behaviour.
We also hope the Commission will now at last be able to take responsibility for creating a strong Europe without nepotism, corruption and affairs.
That is the reason why we voted for the censure motion today.
How sad that the Socialist Group has been playing political games with this, only to get cold feet at the vital moment.
That not only undermines the European ideal, it is also a drain on the energy that we need to implement Agenda 2000.
I just hope that in view of this vote the Commission will at least have the decency to accept responsibility for its actions and that the Commissioners who stand accused will resign.
