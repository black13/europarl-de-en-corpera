Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, over the last few days, and again today, there has been an enormous amount of tactical manoeuvring which has dominated the behaviour of the leading political figures in Parliament.
This has somewhat obscured the fact that a motion of censure is actually a very simple question.
The question is: do the elected representatives of the people still have sufficient confidence in the leadership of the central executive body of the European Union?
The answer to this question has to be either yes or no.
And in my opinion, anyone who listened to Mr Santer on Monday, anyone who has listened to him in recent weeks and has witnessed his behaviour here today, is bound to conclude that given the important tasks ahead of us we can no longer have faith in the leadership abilities of this Commission and its President.
That was what Parliament needed to make a decision about, not about tactical trickery.
This is also the overwhelming view of my social democrat colleagues in the Federal Republic of Germany.
That is why we could see no alternative but to fulfil our parliamentary duty and tell the central administrative institution of the European Union that it is not people who express a lack of confidence who cause an institutional crisis, but people who fail to carry out their distinguished and important duties fully and adequately.
The leader of my group has told us that she has withdrawn the motion of censure submitted by the Socialist Group.
That is not correct.
The motion was submitted by individual members of the Socialist Group.
I would like that to be minuted.
