Mr President, it was with some regret that I voted for the motion of censure against the Commission.
But given the current legal position I had no other choice, as there are people in the Commission, such as Mrs Cresson or Mr Mar√≠n, whose behaviour and character indicate that they are not fit for their job.
I would like to emphasise that my vote was not directed again President Santer, for whom I have the greatest respect.
Today's events have demonstrated that there is still an unfortunate lack of democracy in Europe's institutions.
We need to reform these institutions if Europe is to make real political progress.
The Tindemans Plan provided us with a model that is just as relevant to the current situation as it was all those years ago.
So we do not need to conduct a great deal of research or set up token committees of wise men in order to achieve a substantial reform in the near future.
That is the task facing Parliament in view of today's events.
In this way, in the not too distant future it will be possible - God willing - for a united and enlarged Europe satisfactorily to accomplish its task not only on behalf of the people of Europe but also in the interest of world peace.
