Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I hope I will not seem like a bad loser if I say that this was an own goal.
All the complications and mess that came to light over the 1996 discharge were supposed to be swept away by means of a vote of confidence, but there has not been a vote of confidence.
I too see a committee of wise men as a poor substitute.
We must take this opportunity to make sure that this Commission - which I have already heard described in the corridors as a 'dead man walking' - now at least does whatever is necessary to achieve what Mr Martens rather pompously promised us here: an end to bureaucracy and technocracy.
If Parliament had not voted in such great numbers to express its lack of confidence, the Commission would have sat back and said it was just a storm in a teacup.
That is why I am glad - and I thought long and hard about this - to have supported this initiative and that we have effectively had a vote of no-confidence.
I would like to stress once again - and Mr Berthu can confirm this - that the aim of this initiative was to ensure a strong Commission and a true parliamentary system for Europe, and to make sure that we stop resorting to technocratic and bureaucratic practices, combined with a lack of transparency, to hush up shortcomings in Europe.
Lack of transparency is the real cardinal sin, though this does not mean that we can afford to be complacent about nepotism, mismanagement and fraud.
