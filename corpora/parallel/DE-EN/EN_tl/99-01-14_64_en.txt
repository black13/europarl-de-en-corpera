Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, where do we stand now? 232 Members have voted for the motion of censure, and 27 have abstained.
So in principle, 260 Members of this House have refused to express their confidence in the Commission.
We should not lose sight of that, that is the real message.
I find it totally unacceptable that Mr Santer steered the debate towards talk of reform of administrative structures, smaller private offices, and organisational change.
What is really at stake here are the personal failings of two Commissioners: Mrs Cresson and Mr Mar√≠n.
We are talking here about nepotism and about accepting responsibility for one's actions.
And that is precisely why I and many others have refused to express our confidence in the Commission.
What will happen next, I wonder?
The Commission cannot ignore this vote.
Surely we will not carry on as if nothing has happened?
I am pleased that the CDU/CSU group in the European Parliament unanimously supported this vote of no confidence.
The Socialist Group wants to cover up the Commission's actions.
I cannot emphasise that - and criticise it - too strongly.
However, one thing has certainly come out of this vote - the relationship of the institutions towards each other has changed.
We should not forget this, despite our disappointment that there was not a majority in favour of the motion of censure.
It means that the CDU/CSU Members in this House made the right decision.
