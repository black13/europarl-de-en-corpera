Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as a co-signatory of the motion of censure I of course voted for it and I believe that the large number of Members who supported the motion - about 40 % - makes it clear that the Commission no longer has the support of a broad majority.
The Commission has been wounded by this debate, and politically speaking it is dead in the water.
The fact that there was in effect a grand coalition between the majority groups makes the large number of Members who supported the motion of censure all the more significant.
Considering that in comparison with the BSE motion of censure the number supporting the censure vote has almost doubled, there is every reason to claim that confidence in the European Commission has eroded.
It seems that the European Parliament has taken two steps forward and one step back: having launched itself into the air like a roaring tiger, it has come down to earth again with a sad bump.
It is regrettable that the European Parliament has relinquished its right of control to a 'committee of experts', thus depriving itself of its own rights.
I hope that will not mean that the European Parliament loses credibility, and I particularly regret the tactical manoeuvring of the majority groups.
Although there was wide support for the motion of censure, this is not the place for detailed discussion of the role of the committee of wise men - today should have been a day of political reckoning.
So as a co-signatory I am satisfied with the outcome of the motion of censure, which I think has given the Commission a great deal of food for thought.
