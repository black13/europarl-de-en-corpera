Mr President, our group will also be supporting Mr Fernández Martín's excellent report.
We have spent many years debating democracy, the rule of law, human rights and good governance in developing countries and in the ACP countries.
Negotiating the Lomé IV Convention played an important role, and this report is the next step.
It is important to create the necessary infrastructure to bring about the separation of powers.
To achieve this, however, many countries need support, which we should provide in the areas of development policy and cooperation with the ACP countries.
It is vital that the Joint Assembly is itself pluralistic, and that it is a body which is representative of the various parties and not of authoritarian regimes.
We must act together to ensure this.
We must also act together regarding the allocation of funds.
If we in the EU wish to combat corruption - which was the subject of yesterday's debate - then this also applies to cooperation with the ACP countries.
We should also look into the areas where, by means of infrastructure measures, human rights are being violated by the present international economic system - as Mr Fernández Martín points out in paragraph 7 of his report - that is, due to the debt burden issue, structural adjustment measures or the fact that European companies force the indigenous population to submit to structural adjustment measures, which is often an obstacle to the introduction of the rule of law and the separation of powers.
