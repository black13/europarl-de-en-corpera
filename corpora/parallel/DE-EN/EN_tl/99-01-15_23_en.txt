Mr President, I would of course like to endorse the congratulations offered to Mr Fernández Martín.
I naturally attach great importance to this report and to the Commission report, because the ever-recurring conflicts between the United States of America and Europe can be attributed not least to the fact that we have particularly close economic ties with 70 countries throughout the world and that great mutual support exists.
I believe that it is quite natural that we, as Europeans, should attempt to introduce and support, in these 70 countries with which we cooperate, certain principles which we have recognised as being correct, and that we look upon them practically as a basic condition in this area.
Allow me, however, to make a slight criticism of this report that seems to me to be very important.
It relates to the fact that, once national rights have been established, we naturally place a great deal of emphasis on human rights and thus on the individual.
The fact that there are certain groups which also have rights is unfortunately being ignored.
The groups I am specifically referring to are the minority groups and the various ethnic groups which live in these countries and which unfortunately are not mentioned in this report.
We see only too often that it is these very minority groups which are treated abominably and have no rights whatsoever.
In this connection I have in mind certain African countries, for example in the Great Lakes region.
If we look at what is happening in Rwanda and Burundi, it is my belief that it is enormously important for us, as a European Parliament that continually supports not only individual human rights but also the rights of ethnic groups, to ensure that the rights of these groups are guaranteed at an international level, which is not the case at the moment.
