Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased with this very detailed and unambiguous report by Mr Elchlepp.
I am also very pleased that it is slowly getting through to this House that renewable energies will be quite crucial in the future.
We have neglected this sector for far too long.
For far too long we have relied on energy sources that cost the earth and cannot be disposed of, such as nuclear power, for example.
This report gives us the opportunity to place our future hopes in new energy sources, in tandem with the countries in the south and with the new countries in the east.
This is also a special challenge for the German Presidency, which is held by Joschka Fischer.
We will need money, which we must take away from other energy sources, to effect this volte-face.
Despite the fact that new oil reserves are still being discovered, word should have got around by now that this substance is finite.
That is why we must follow this new path out of our responsibility towards future generations.
