Madam President, I would like first and foremost to congratulate Mr Elchlepp.
I have been in Parliament for 20 years now and rarely has there been such a good report as the one he has written.
Many thanks.

However, I would like to broaden the subject somewhat to include an area which lies particularly close to my heart.
We have a massive market for renewable energies on our very doorstep, that is, in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.
I should like to cite as examples the countries which I frequently visit: Hungary, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Lithuania.
In all these regions there is still a tremendous amount of work to be done.
In this regard, Mr Elchlepp, I should like to add one point to your excellent report.
The people in these countries do not yet know enough about renewable energies.
They must be informed and the governments must be informed, because we are dealing here in with certain large commercial concerns which have no interest whatsoever in the use of renewable energies and will therefore do everything they possibly can to stifle it.
I should therefore like to ask you to ensure that both the people of these countries, and their governments, who also do not know enough, are informed.
In this context, two points are of particular relevance.
It must not be forgotten that under the Russian regime many dreadful sins were committed against the environment, but now in these countries the environment is being severely damaged by lignite.
The massive utilisation of lignite, which I see especially in Hungary, for example, in the region of Obosar, must be replaced by energy sources which have no such harmful impact on the environment.
This is a task which it behoves us to carry out because we can achieve so much in this field.
We can and should give these countries a great deal, because in these countries we can start from scratch and carve out the correct path.
Applause
