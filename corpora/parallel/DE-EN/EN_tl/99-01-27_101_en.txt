Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioners, the Member State governments and you too, ladies and gentlemen, have always emphasised, in relation to Agenda 2000, that the Union's new structural policy must observe the guiding principles of concentration, efficiency and administrative agreement.
I would add that transparency must also be a basic guiding principle.
Accordingly the Commission has presented a proposal for implementing these principles and establishing broad coherence between the Structural Fund aid and national aid.
That is consistent and it is a sensible solution.
I hope the Member States also decide to follow that line consistently.
What it so significant is that this is the only way to restrict competition about standards and the abuse of aid.
But we will also find that the different authorisation times in the different Member States will make it very easy to circumvent this.
So I ask the Commission to tell us how it proposes to organise the authorisation timing so as to prevent this from happening.
Let me also point out that the Commission proposal does not deal with one particular problem, namely subsidy shopping.
National undertakings can still go on taking up aid unchecked and thereby damage regions.
So in that respect there are a few things missing in the proposal.
How are you going to resolve this question?
