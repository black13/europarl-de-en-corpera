Madam President, the Agenda 2000 proposals as also this report seek to strengthen the complementarity between competition and regional policy.
The arguments put forward for this are the ever widening divergences between policies and the overlaps in the various aid maps.
But those who support this approach are forgetting that the desired equal cover of national and EU aid areas makes it even more difficult for the Member States and regions to support their own problem areas by using their own resources.
That reinforces this policy of positive discrimination in favour of the most disadvantaged regions.
In any case the objectives of Agenda 2000, namely greater concentration and coherence, already involve a serious cutback in aid to the relatively successful regions.
It would be not just absurd but in fact inconsistent with the very principle of subsidiarity to also deprive them de facto of the instrument of national aid.
