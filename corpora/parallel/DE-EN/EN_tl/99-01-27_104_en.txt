Madam President, I want to confine my comments to two aspects.
First, let me unreservedly agree with what is stated so clearly for the first time in paragraphs 17 to 20 of Mr Azzolini's excellent report: tourism is a good thing!
For many parts of Europe tourism is the key to survival.
But subsidised tourism is a bad thing, it is unacceptable, because it does not produce sustained structural improvement but simply throws away and wastes huge amounts of European money.
When an undertaking that receives a large amount of aid relocates to the next place, it generally leaves far more damage than useful things behind it.
So let us put an end to this nonsense as quickly as possible!
Let the Commission apply its collective wisdom to finding good solutions.
This brings me to the second aspect I want to address.
We also need good solutions to Agenda 2000 as a whole and to structural reform in particular.
We need these good solutions quickly.
We have barely two months left under the German Presidency's new timetable and we have to put this time to good use.
The Commission and the European Parliament have done good work together in the past months.
Now the Council has to show that it can reach consensus.
It will certainly not be easy to accommodate fifteen different opinions on this difficult subject.
The Council must now show that it is prepared to cooperate with the Commission, but also and in particular with Parliament, which has been playing a very responsible part in this process so far and sought to find common, rational and objective solutions, but which must now also attach great importance to being included in the final decisions.
We cannot wait another seven years for the assent provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty to enter into force.
We want to have a constructive say now.
