Mr President, the slower-than-slow approach to reducing emissions that was adopted in Buenos Aires is like trying to have a wash without getting wet.
An effective policy on the global climate will not be achieved until the real cost of emitting active substances into the atmosphere is borne in full by the polluter.
For that to happen, we need a suitable legal framework.
The oft-repeated excuse that reducing emission levels is too expensive is suicidal.
A society that is unwilling to invest in the preservation of its own vital resources, and hence in the survival of the human species, is doomed to extinction.
The emissions catalogue that was negotiated in Buenos Aires is no way to tackle the problem.
In the long run, problems can only be solved at the point where they actually occur.
