Mr President, Commissioner, you referred to the role of the United States.
I believe the issue today is a different one.
It is about the need for the European Union to take the lead here.
To put it plainly, loopholes in the Protocol such as the scope for emissions trading must not be used as a means of wriggling out of responsibility.
Which takes us straight to this question: what has happened to the promised measures?
I should also like to hear from you exactly what is to happen now with regard to the implementation of the White Paper on renewable energy sources?
You referred to the key role that the energy tax is to play.
All right, we now have a proposal on an energy consumption tax, but that is surely a tiny step.
After all, the Commission itself has admitted that the implementation of this proposal will not prevent a 6 % increase in emission levels by the year 2010.
What did you say about the most intractable problem of all, namely transport?
We know that CO2 emissions by vehicles are set to rise by 38 % between now and 2010.
Here too, I would ask you to answer the questions my fellow Members have been asking.
When will kerosene finally be taxed?
When will you make some serious efforts to honour the promise that was made to us last year?
We need action, not paper and not fine words.
