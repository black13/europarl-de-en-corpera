Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very grateful to Mr Colino Salamanca for the statements he has made.
But let me clarify the Commission's point of view again.
Firstly, we have to distinguish in the proposals between measures that are obligatory and those that are voluntary, meaning first of all those that are obligatory or voluntary on the part of the farmer.
So the point is that the farmer is guaranteed the same level of direct payments, which correspond to compensatory payments, but that these will be subject to the general requirement of what is called gross compliance, which the Member States are indeed required to impose.
It will no doubt prove possible under the implementing provisions also to coordinate the level of these requirements in such a way as to avoid any bias.
The second aspect is the voluntary payments, which must go beyond normal practice.
That is one of the conditions of eligibility for such payments in the first place.
But here too it is clear that they are a component of the second pillar, namely rural development policy.
After all our proposal is that we must have a rural development policy of this kind for every rural region.
But the proposals also specify that a programme will only be accepted if it definitely incorporates an 'agri-environmental measures' heading.
Seen from that aspect, I believe our proposals to a very large extent satisfy your requirements.
