Mr President, Mr Fischler, would you admit that environment-friendly agriculture is still the exception, that intensive farming is still the rule, that price reductions within the intervention system trigger more intensive production?
Secondly, I find it very sensible for you to say that the second pillar should contain an environment-based programme, but the funding is very low.

That is not subsidiarity, it is giving free rein.
Two small examples: in set-aside land you allow chemical industrial raw materials to be used in farming but you do not allow vegetables to be grown for animal feed.
My other example ...
