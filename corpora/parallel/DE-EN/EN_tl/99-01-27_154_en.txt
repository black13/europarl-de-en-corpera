Mr President, I shall not do that, because the purpose of this debate is to draw some clear political lines at long last.
I did not say that Parliament alone was to blame; Germany, my own Member State, has blocked the solution of this problem for ten years.
I have spent ten years repeating the arguments that Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz has presented this evening.
I am damned if I will apologise, because this is a proper democratic discussion.
You have been wrong for the past ten years, and now you do not want to admit it!
That is unacceptable.
Duplicity kills democracy!
