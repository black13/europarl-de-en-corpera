Just a brief comment, Mr President.
Commissioner, I have absolutely no idea why you should be pillorying Parliament.
With regard to the chocolate directive, I was merely trying to express precisely what you went on to say.
The Council thinks it is entitled to drag this whole thing out, and the other business too.
But if you can quote anything in our Rules of Procedure or in the Maastricht Treaty to show how Parliament could have been any quicker in dealing with this matter, I shall naturally be more than willing to act on your advice when the other two subjects come up.
But I agree with you entirely that both of us - the Commission and Parliament - should pillory the Council.
That was all I said.
