Mr President, I welcome the consideration given by the rapporteur to the aspects of social policy that have taken on a new dimension in the modern information society.
I also support the amendments that are designed to take account of these new factors.
We must, for example, be absolutely rigorous in ensuring that disabled people are given access to service models that meet their special needs.
The development of public access to the Internet, in schools and libraries for instance, is an extremely important matter to which this and other Parliaments ought to devote more attention in the future.
The information society must not lead to wider social disparities.
If access by part of the population to the information media is denied or obstructed, stark differences in education levels will result, and these could create a glaring inequality of opportunity in the job market.
