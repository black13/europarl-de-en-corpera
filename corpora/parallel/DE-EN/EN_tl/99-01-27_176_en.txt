Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the liberalisation of the telecommunications sector was a pioneering strategy which not only represented another step from the single market towards a European domestic market, but also had a significant dimension in terms of employment.
This development was referred to when we assessed the implementation of the reform package.
The information society is currently responsible for every fourth new job in the European Union.
For that we owe our thanks to the Commission, and especially to Mr Bangemann.
The Read report makes the accessibility of the basic services at acceptable prices and standards of quality a prerequisite of our support for the present liberalisation process.
I would like to go further than that.
The provision of a universal service can ultimately be a logical result and product of liberalisation.
What exactly are the universal services?
They are generally held to comprise a minimum range of telecommunications services of a certain quality that can be made available to all users at reasonable prices.
This includes access to standard public telephone services, such as 999 calls, directory enquiries and special facilities for people with particular disabilities.
This subject is therefore important in terms of the general confidence which the European technology of the future must enjoy.
It is also clear that in many areas, market forces cannot be given free rein from the outset.
That is why the concept of affordability is such a topical issue these days - and rightly so.
The affordability principle means that the Member States set geographical average prices, price ceilings and so forth.
One of the important aspects of this mechanism is the scope for easing unreasonable burdens on providers of universal services.
But I do support the Commission when it says that such measures can only apply until the market is competitive enough to exercise effective price control itself.
