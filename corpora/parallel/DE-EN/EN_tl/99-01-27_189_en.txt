Mr President, even at this late hour, a certain degree of attentiveness is required.
I found it difficult to follow the Commissioner's interesting remarks because the background noise level had risen very perceptibly in this Chamber, where sound carries over considerable distances, as a result of individual conversations.
Please ensure in future that we can listen in silence to every speaker.
Please advise Members and parliamentary staff that conversations involving groups of people can be conducted outside.
