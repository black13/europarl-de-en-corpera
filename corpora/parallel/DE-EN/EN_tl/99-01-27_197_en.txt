Mr President, actions, not fine words - that is absolutely the right approach; that has to be appreciated from the outset.
An employment pact, rather than an alliance for goodness, beauty, truth or other intangible values, seems to me to be the proper step for us to take at this time.
There is much in Mr Mann's report that we are able to endorse, and we are opposed to any attempt by the PPE to emasculate it, but there are also a few points in it which are rather unclear.
So that we can have these points clarified, I shall try to present them systematically.
There are two possible sets of measures.
Additional demand for work can be created.
This can be achieved by means of an employment-oriented economic policy, by restructuring society and the tax system in line with environmental objectives, and by developing the tertiary sector to create social tasks which are necessary but which the market does not perform.
The second set of measures is designed to cut back the available volume of work.
This can be achieved by redistributing the workload, reducing working hours, introducing part-time work, reorganising the work process, cutting the supply of work to employees by granting individual and collective rights to leave of absence and by granting sabbatical leave, which Mr Mann had in his report but which his group now wishes to delete.
This training measure has the dual effect of improving the quality of human resources after the sabbatical year and drastically reducing the available labour pool during it.
These measures can be taken, and we can close the labour gap in the European Union: 27 to 34 million, the Commission has calculated.
To do this, however, we must consciously address the problem, and for that we need a very substantive employment pact, not just a finely worded document.
We are in agreement on that.
