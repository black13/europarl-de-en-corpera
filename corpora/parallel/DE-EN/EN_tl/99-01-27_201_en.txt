Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a few weeks ago, the unemployment rate dipped below 10 % for the first time in several years.
That is encouraging, but let us not rest on our laurels.
In particular, it would seem important to highlight positive trends and future job markets.
Thomas Mann's excellent report is especially valuable in this sense.
He quite rightly states that employers have an obligation to ensure the continuous training of their employees.
The point here is that the ability of staff to apply the latest specialised knowledge will primarily serve the interests of their employer.
That is why lifelong learning must be at the forefront as the prime instrument with which we can increase the level of employment throughout the Union, because only consumers can create jobs.
For this reason, it is essential to supply products and services that will actually be bought.
Care should also be taken to ensure that when a company changes hands there is a possibility of securing the jobs of the existing staff and subsequently expanding the workforce.
The report also refers to the fear that technological change could result in more redundancies than new jobs.
We must work resolutely and systematically to allay those fears.
The information society, for example, is the most dynamic economic sector in the European Union.
It already accounts for 5 % of our total GDP, is growing faster than every other sector and is creating more jobs too.
More than four million people are already employed by companies in the field of information and communications technology.
More than 300 000 new jobs were created in this area of the information society between 1995 and 1997.
But this potential has not been exhausted by any means.
There are still about 500 000 vacancies for ICT specialists.
Opportunities abound.
All we have to do is take them.
