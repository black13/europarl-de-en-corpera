Mr President, a cage is no place to live in.
And Mr Kindermann's honest and well-intentioned report will certainly do nothing to change that, because all it achieves is better cages and then only in ten years' time.
What we want is no cages at all, and I therefore hope that the amendments tabled by my honourable friend Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf will be approved tomorrow, because until we stop thinking of animals just as commodities with a sell-by date, supplying us with products as cheaply as possible, we shall not have decent and appropriate methods of animal husbandry.
We really must start seeing animals as they really are, namely living creatures, and not commodities to be used and then discarded at will.
I therefore urge the House to vote for our amendments tomorrow.
It would also be very beneficial to consumers if we do so, in the interests of health.
Only decent and appropriate methods of livestock management will produce healthy products.
