Mr President, Commissioner, I am in favour of abandoning the use of cages for laying hens.
Naturally, I welcome the Commission's initiative to improve things and draw up a new directive, but that is not enough.
Even the Scientific Veterinary Committee agrees that the current method of keeping birds in cages is particularly problematic.
I think it is an especially cruel form of livestock management which should be eliminated as soon as possible.
Of course perches, litter, baths and nestboxes are an improvement, but are we not once again encouraging producers to invest money which will very soon prove to have been wasted?
The fact is that more and more consumers throughout Europe are calling for a blanket ban on cages.
This will come, the only question is when.
We have 250 million hens in conventional cages, and only eight million free-range hens.
Certainly we cannot change that overnight, but we can change it in maybe eight, nine or ten years, and the amendments tabled by Mr Ebner, Mr Watts and Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf are all aimed at achieving that.
Europe's farmers have enough land to make the change, and the extra jobs will no doubt be easy to fill!
And battery farming cannot be healthy.
These poor hens usually die after a year, they last no longer than that, whereas a normal chicken usually lives for four to five years.
The extra cost to the consumer of an appropriate system of poultry management is estimated by the Commission - and for this too we thank them - at two euros per person per year.
Anyone who has ever seen a battery cage operation goes right off eggs for a very long time!
But the enlightened, informed consumer is perfectly willing to pay a little more and - once again I quote the Commission here - wants to see cages scrapped.
Please vote tomorrow in favour of Amendments Nos 52, 62 and 67.
You will all find that your breakfast egg tastes a little better!
