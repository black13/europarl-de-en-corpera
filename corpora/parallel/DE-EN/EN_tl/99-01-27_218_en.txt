Mr President, I too very much regret the fact that neither the Commission report nor Mr Kindermann's report proposes ending the practice of keeping laying hens in cages.
As long as cages continue to be used, even if they are bigger and fitted with a perch, we cannot really speak of appropriate methods of keeping these birds.
The European Parliament ought to prove that it wants no half-hearted compromises in matters of animal welfare, and it should vote for those amendments which seek to have the cage system done away with altogether.
The fact that 93 % of eggs produced for consumption in the EU come from battery cages must not stand in the way of a ban on this shameful form of mass animal torment.
Rather, this figure proves that the European consumer is not sufficiently aware of animal welfare issues, or of questions of product quality.
