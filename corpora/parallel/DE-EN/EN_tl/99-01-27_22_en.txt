Mr President, Mrs Hardstaff, this is not in fact directly connected with today's subject but I would like to tell you one thing quite clearly: what we will and must do is, as stated in the panels' findings, to adjust our risk assessment to the WTO provisions.
In all the Commission has commissioned eight scientific studies.
We are now awaiting the findings of these studies and I hope we can then adhere to our position, as we have always intended.
