Mr President, Mr Fischler, am I right in assuming that in fact you drew up Agenda 2000 in order to make farmers more competitive on the world market and not in order to reduce the consumption of fertilisers and other means of production that farmers urgently need?
That is my first question.
Mrs Bjerregaard's explanation was about the last reason that could be given for why we have to implement the Agenda at all!
Second question: can you tell me what percentage of the aid under Regulation 20/78 the Member States are taking up?
In my region it is 100 %, so it is worth raising this matter.
I would also like you to tell me what you mean in real terms by agricultural practice.
Please do not confuse the concepts of intensive farming and farming appropriate to the location!
