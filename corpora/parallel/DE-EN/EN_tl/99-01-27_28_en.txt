Mr President, Mr Robles Piquer, on the second part of your question, whether we are also prepared to encourage biomass farming and the production of alternative energy sources, i.e. renewable raw materials, let me reply as follows.
Firstly, our proposals on cereal growing and oilseeds do provide for support for these products.
Secondly, under our proposals for rural development, investment in this sector is also eligible for support measures.
Thirdly, we have included an expanded forestry chapter in the rural development proposals, and these forestry support measures will also provide for increased support for wood as a renewable raw material.
