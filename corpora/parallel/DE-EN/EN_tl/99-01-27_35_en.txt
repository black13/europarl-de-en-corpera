Mr President, Mr Campos, let me first address the question of expenditure in relation to the percentage of the farming population.
To be fair, you would have to compare it with total public expenditure.
If you add the national budgets to the Community budget and then deduct the agricultural part, you obtain a percentage of 2 % for 5 % of the population.
I do not think that is really excessive.
Secondly, on jobs in agriculture, there is only one thing I can say to you.
The more environment-friendly our farming is, the more jobs that will imply and not the reverse.
So this proposal to incorporate environmental aspects more firmly in the reform is certainly in the interests of agriculture and of jobs.
But there is one thing you must not forget.
If we are going to discuss making these additional demands on European agriculture, and in fact considerably higher demands than we make on our overseas competitors, then we must also be prepared to pay for it.
And we also have to stop arguing that agricultural reform must not cost anything!
