Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I can entirely agree with Mr Fantuzzi here.
I really do find it most regrettable that this report is based in part on statements that are consistent neither with our actual proposals nor with the current state of the discussions.
I invite you to endeavour jointly with us to give the public more objective information, to protect agriculture against wrong and biased accusations.
