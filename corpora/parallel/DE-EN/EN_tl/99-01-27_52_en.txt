Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, have you forgotten?
We are living in a post-cold war era.
Europe is surrounded only by friends.
This is an age of peace.
It is the age of disarmament.
It is the arms industry that is not prepared to adapt to the new criteria of an age of disarmament and that is sounding the alarm.
It is calling for industrial mergers that would not be approved in the civil sector.
It is calling for subsidies, for political support for arms exports; it is calling for a more flexible policy on cartels.
What forces us to give in to these demands when we know that it would be senseless to do so, when we know that this will not solve the global problems facing mankind, the problems of unemployment and poverty, the problems of climate change?
Do not forget that we created Konver to replace rather than supplement rearmament.
That is why the Greens reject this report.
