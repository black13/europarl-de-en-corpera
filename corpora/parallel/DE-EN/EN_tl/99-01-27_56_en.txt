Mr President, I would have preferred to see this important report discussed primarily in terms of security policy rather than economic policy aspects, for it represents a major step forwards towards achieving a Common Foreign and Security Policy, and surely the political need for that should gradually become undisputed.
Unfortunately perhaps, that requires an arms and arms procurement policy coordinated at European level.
Why?
Firstly, I am convinced that it is important for Europe to retain some independence in providing itself with military assets.
What I regard as important is not so much economic competition but a policy that is independent of the United States.
Secondly, it is also quite crucial for us to reduce our existing surplus capacity in the arms industry only on a basis of coordination, thereby also preventing financial resources from being wrongly allocated to arms contracts that are awarded under the heading of 'we want to protect jobs by creating more employment'.
We are all familiar with examples of this kind in our own home countries.
I also believe it is important that we consistently include the Central and Eastern European countries.
They are facing the biggest problems here and I believe, especially in view of EU and also NATO enlargement, that it is important that we include them here.
I regret - here I agree with the direction taken in the report - that the Konver programme is not being continued.
We have to demand that it is!
In the end it is not a question of markets.
The arms industry is not a question of markets and I believe that security policy is the decisive aspect, which is why it is important that we coordinate the arms industry, arms procurement, on a European basis in the interests of the Common Foreign and Security Policy.
