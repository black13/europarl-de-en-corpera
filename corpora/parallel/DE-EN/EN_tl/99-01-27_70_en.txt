Mr President, Commissioner, the realisation that security policy is closely bound up with environmental questions is to be welcomed on principle.
The conclusion that military activities have far-reaching environmental effects is also important.
But I would also draw your attention to a circumstance to which more account must be given in our future peace policy work.
In Africa as also in the Middle East, in South America and in the states of the former Soviet Union wars are being waged about oil and other resources.
Only when we manage to do away with this central source of war over the past century and move instead towards renewable primary energy sources will we see the first real success in regard to long-term peace protection on an environmental basis.
I regard one point as particularly important here.
The EU should launch an offensive against the increasingly widespread problem of mercenaries, which is very much implicated in this fight for resources.
Mercenary troops should be prohibited worldwide and their European headquarters should be prosecuted.
