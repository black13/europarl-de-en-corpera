Madam President, I should like to clear up one more point concerning the vote on Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf's report.
I think there was some confusion at the end.
We approved the report, and as I understand it the rapporteur's request for referral back to committee concerned the legislative resolution.
So this is not a referral back to committee, but simply a referral of the legislative resolution forward into a better future.
We are counting on the wisdom of the Commission and the Council to round the whole thing off nicely.
