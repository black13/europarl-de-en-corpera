Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Goepel has in fact asked two questions.
The first refers to the option of transfer with or without the corresponding land.
I am prepared to accept the amendments relating to this.
As regards the superlevy, I should point out that a more flexible superlevy is not something which can be achieved overnight.
In the meantime, we are discussing a possible review of the operation of the milk system, about half-way through the conversion period, so in 2003 or thereabouts, and consequently I would prefer it if we could take this matter up again after that review has taken place.
