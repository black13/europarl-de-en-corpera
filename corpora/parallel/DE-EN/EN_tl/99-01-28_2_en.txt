Madam President, I have a point of order on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media.
At the sitting of Wednesday, 13 January 1999 in Strasbourg, Commissioner Bangemann spoke on the Malerba report on globalisation and the information society.
The Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media is sorry to see that Mr Bangemann is apparently so afraid of it that he felt obliged to exercise his prerogatives under the Rules of Procedure and criticise the committee as a whole for having presumed to express its own views on the substance of the report in the form of a letter.
But the committee members can be forgiving of Mr Bangemann's remarks.
The Committee on Culture is happy that its principal comments on the Green Paper on convergence were taken on board last October.
Mr Bangemann must have been sorely disappointed to find that a committee which he regards as so insignificant was in fact able to push through its main ideas on convergence.
