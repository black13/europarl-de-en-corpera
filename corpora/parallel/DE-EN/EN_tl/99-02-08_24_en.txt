Mr President, I had the good fortune to serve alongside Mrs DÃ­ez de Rivera Icaza on the Environment Committee from 1984 to 1989.
She really had a great fighting spirit, but at the same time she was flexible and ever cheerful.
She and I, and also Beate Weber, worked together very successfully during that period.
On behalf of our entire group I would like to wish her a speedy recovery and a good future.
