Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am very happy indeed to support the report presented by Mrs Jackson, because I believe this represents a great step forward in environmental matters for the whole of Europe.
Although it will involve some tightening up in Austria, I have to say that a number of provisions already apply in Austria which it would have been impossible to gain acceptance for throughout Europe.
I certainly tried to emphasise this by the way I voted in committee.
I would like to illustrate this point with a single example - Article 6, the classification of waste according to categories of waste.
It is to be permissible to deposit certain types of solid non-reactive hazardous waste on landfill sites for non-hazardous waste.
This relates to waste which is categorised as hazardous because of handling issues, that is to say where there is a risk of inappropriate handling, but which can in fact be deposited with other non-reactive waste without any risk to the environment.
This implies waste with low leachability.
Such waste cannot be deposited in Austria unless it can be scientifically proven that it is not dangerous in landfill conditions.
We have also developed a model for providing this proof.
This chiefly relates to vitrified or solidified hazardous waste.
I believe that this is a very important point which we will have to reflect on again in the future.
Nevertheless, this directive represents a great step forward for Europe and I am therefore really pleased to give it my approval.
