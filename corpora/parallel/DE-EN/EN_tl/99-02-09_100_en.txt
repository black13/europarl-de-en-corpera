Mrs Read's report has shown that a mixed assessment of the progress made on universal service provision is in order.
Overall, progress is rather unsatisfactory.
That is why renewed efforts need to be made.
We Greens support this conclusion in Mrs Read's report.
In addition, however, it is necessary to consider whether in fact more instruments are needed - such as specifications, different levels of state supervision and so on - to increase the public interest element, to safeguard the quality of the services and to take account of the social and societal impact of new services.
Some instruments of this kind are already provided for under media law and can be used as models.
