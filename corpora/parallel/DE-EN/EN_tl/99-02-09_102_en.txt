As regards the increases in thresholds proposed in the report, past experience shows that the lower the thresholds are set, the more firms participate in public calls for tender.
However, a correspondingly larger number of businesses then fail to receive a slice of the cake.
This also results in an overall increase in what might be termed futile expenditure.
However, since I personally am against raising thresholds on principle, I have abstained on the paragraphs in question.
