Mr President, the proposal for a directive is significant because it points the way ahead.
This has already become clear from the public response.
The right of artists to have their works protected must also be guaranteed in the age of the Internet.
For this to be the case, a legal framework needs to be established and the rapporteur has successfully done this.
I can support most of the amendments proposed by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights.
Alongside the pro-artist provisions, I should in particular like to draw your attention to the proposed rules on the use of archive productions.
I think that the rules need to offer incentives to producers - producers of audio media and those who work for radio - to provide on-line access to the productions they have either produced themselves or on someone else's behalf.
The new technology can make it possible for the film and audio material currently languishing in cellars to be made available to a much larger audience.
Finally, however, let me sound a note of criticism on the linguistic quality of the proposal.
Parts of it are, I think, the perfect example of legislation which is remote and difficult to understand, and which intrinsically fails to comply with the rule of transparency.
