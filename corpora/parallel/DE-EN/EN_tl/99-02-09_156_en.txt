Mr President, in my opinion, the report drawn up by Mr Barzanti is a very balanced document.
Whenever the paths cross of those who own intellectual property rights and those who have access to the information, there is a conflict.
I believe that the property issue is a fundamental one, and that this is not a question of how the information is disseminated.
For this reason, I believe that the principles Mr Barzanti has identified and incorporated into his report are the right ones.
Obviously exceptions are needed, but they should be limited and should uphold the rules on the protection of intellectual property.
I will soon have served as a Member of Parliament - both at national level and here - for 20 years, and in all that time I have never before been lobbied so intensively on an issue by the interest groups.
When it comes to the vote, I hope that this Parliament will not help the new forms of media - which have a role to play and should be able to do so - to strike it rich, at the expense of authors.
