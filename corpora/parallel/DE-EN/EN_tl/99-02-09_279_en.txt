Mr President, I really thought that my explanation on that point was very clear.
I clearly stated that the present GATT rules do not allow us to keep a ban on imports of must.
If we are to comply with GATT, we have to change this.
However, what we very probably can do is to ensure that imported must, even if it is mixed with musts produced in the Community, is adequately labelled so that anyone can see that the wine in question has been produced from imported musts.
So it is a question of ensuring that consumers can see that a wine containing imported must is indeed a wine that is either partly or entirely produced from imported must.
But we cannot simply ban imports of must.
