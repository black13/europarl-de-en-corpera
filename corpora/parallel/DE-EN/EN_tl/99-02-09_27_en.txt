Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I fully support Mr Cox's report.
It makes the Commission proposal clearer and ensures that it will be effective.
Nonetheless, I should like to take up two points which are mentioned in the Environment Committee's report.
At this stage, I should also like to thank Mr Spencer, in particular, for his determined efforts on this matter and for his trusting cooperation.
The first point concerns the issue of renewable sources of energy.
I believe that if we also want this tax reform to result in a change of direction, then we need to exempt renewables from this tax, because we should not make them subject to national competition.
If one country says it will exempt them and another says it will not, then this issue will immediately be at the mercy of competition.
That is why we should send out a clear signal based on Mr Cox's proposal - clear, efficient rules.
I say: let us exempt renewables from this tax.
The second point relates to the sector currently responsible for the greatest increases in CO2 emissions, namely aviation.
Last year, there was a 17 % increase in CO2 emissions.
This sector is completely excluded because there are certain problems with levying this tax on kerosene.
I would urge you, therefore, to accept Amendment No 29 and to say that we are bearing this in mind and that we instruct the Commission to propose an adequate solution so that this sector too can be included.
