Madam President, at a time when in many European Union countries asylum seekers are not necessarily regarded as refugees who are to be welcomed, Mrs Lindeperg's report is a valuable document.
She is a Member of Parliament with the courage of her convictions.
Migration is a social reality in the European Union.
We are concerned about the tendency in some Member States to substitute temporary so-called refuge for genuine recognition of refugee status under the Geneva Convention.
The EU should not harmonise forms of protection supplementing the Geneva Convention without allowing for a liberal interpretation of the Convention on the status of refugees.
For this reason we welcome the debate needed on the Austrian strategy paper on migration and asylum policy.
The report makes it clear that Austria's so-called strategy paper is intended as a deterrent, and is not suitable as a basis for solving the problems of migration and asylum-seekers, because it confuses not only the various issues surrounding their causes, but also the solutions to these problems.
Of course there is an urgent need for coordinated action.
The objective is to create approximately equivalent admission criteria for refugees by means of a common legal protection system, so that recognition criteria can be interpreted as uniformly as possible.
Mrs Lindeperg's report makes a valuable contribution to this.
I would also like to say something about the two amendments tabled by my group.
It is our view that Amendments Nos 16 and 17 are not relevant to this debate.
A debate about the future or the fate of refugees in general is not the place for a discussion of what has happened to Mr Ocalan.
That should be dealt with separately.
