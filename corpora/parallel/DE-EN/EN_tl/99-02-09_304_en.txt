Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, many speeches on asylum and refugees in Europe remind me of Bertold Brecht's famous play 'The Good Woman of Szechuan', in which the main character has to work hard at night as a realist to put right the damage she has done as a philanthropist during the day.
We are being urged to drop the visa requirement for Romania and Bulgaria, yet any security specialist can show that this would promote organised crime, traffic in human beings and drug smuggling.
Where does that leave our concern for our citizens' security?
Here in Europe, we quite rightly accept refugees and people facing political persecution.
There is no dispute about that, as every right-minded person knows.
However, there are also numerous economic refugees who can neither come here nor remain here permanently, and now Mrs Lindeperg is proposing that we should accept everyone coming from countries where there is widespread violence, internal conflict, or other circumstances which have severely disrupted public order.
My dear Mrs Lindeperg, this definition applies to three quarters of Africa and half of Asia.
So provision is to be made for measures to ensure that all these people are integrated into social and economic life - not forgetting that we have 20 million unemployed in Europe - and at the same time, if they are rejected, they can lodge an appeal with suspensory effect!
Mrs Lindeperg, that may well earn our respect and you may deserve our sympathy, but it will not win our vote for your report.
It is high time we limited immigration into Europe.
Only then will we have a chance of integrating those who already live here, and that should be our priority.
