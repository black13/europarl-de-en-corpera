Madam President, of course as a member of the Greens, I too - as Mr Spencer said - would have liked this to be an even greener proposal.
However, as a Green, I can say that I regard this as an important, if tentative step, in fact only a first small step forward on taxation - or at least harmonisation - in this sector.
If I may, however, I shall also make two points: I think Mr Cox was right to say that renewables should be exempted, because of course this is also about triggering a turning-point in our energy policy.
We all know that the future belongs to renewables, and that here too we need to set the right course.
I am also hoping, however, that the House will support our amendment seeking to exempt local public transport, because this too is a decisive point.
If we want to contribute towards reducing CO2 emissions, then we need to cut the damaging numbers of private cars on the roads, which is of course one of the aims of this tax on consumption.
But it is also necessary to create incentives for environmentally friendly local public transport.
We also believe that we should not continue to subsidise air traffic.
There are other possibilities, such as a tax on CO2 emissions, which might exonerate us from the principle of unanimity, and which would also be compatible with international agreements.
It is to be hoped, therefore, that the Commission will finally present an adequate proposal to us in March.
To sum up: we think that this is an important step in the right direction.
