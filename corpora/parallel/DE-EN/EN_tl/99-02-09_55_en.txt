Mr President, you will see that there are a whole series of Luxembourg Members on the list of speakers.
The debate must have something to do with Luxembourg.
I well remember the Luxembourg Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, Jean-Claude Juncker, stating on more than one occasion that where this important issue was concerned, he saw the coexistence system as providing a definite opportunity to achieve an acceptable degree of harmonisation in terms of taxing interest.
You see, Mrs Randzio-Plath, this is not just about savings income, but about income of any kind received by physical persons.
That is why the committee also proposed including Eurobonds, so that the United Kingdom and the City of London would not be virtually exempted from the provisions.
The second key point in Parliament and in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy was deciding what tax rate to opt for in the coexistence model.
The Commission has proposed 20 % and Mr Fayot 10 %.
However, there do not seem to be any amendments calling for 10 %.
I have not seen any, despite reading them all.
We have proposed 15 %, and I believe that this is a reasonable approach.
Curiously, Mr PÃ©rez Royo, speaking in his capacity as rapporteur, has just mentioned 20 % - it is not for him to do so.
We adopted the report with 15 %, and it is the rapporteur's duty to convey that here too.
I should like to recommend that we give our full backing to the compromise reached in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy: a minimum rate of 15 %, with an invitation to work towards greater harmonisation in negotiations with third countries at OECD level, and in the knowledge, Commissioner Monti, that your commendable work on tax harmonisation finally needs a worthwhile result.
We hope that this will be the case, for our own and for your sakes.
I hope that it will be possible, despite unanimity, to find a sensible solution.
