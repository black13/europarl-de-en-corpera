Mr President, we should like to thank the rapporteur for the work he has done on this rather technical proposal.
Although these are technical changes, he is also right to say that this is actually about safety and environmental considerations, which are important policy objectives for us.
Of course, our proposal is also intended to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market, and to make it easier for manufacturers to comply with the provisions by introducing a standard form of type approval.
We can accept four of the amendments tabled, Nos 3, 4, 5 and 6.
As far as the other four amendments are concerned, we believe that this is not the appropriate place for some of these rules, and that instead we can refer to provisions which either already exist or are to be adopted; that is why we do not think that we can accept these amendments.
However, Mr Camis√≥n Asensio, ladies and gentlemen, given that this is the first reading, we will certainly have further opportunities to look at details, and an overall agreement may still be possible.
