There is no doubt that, despite all the efforts made, disparities of development between the regions of the EU still remain wide.
On the other hand, a strict application of the principle of concentration - which we must strive for if cohesion policy instruments are to be deployed effectively - must not overlook the fact that, in the context of subsidiarity, national support measures must continue to be permitted outside these regions.
The so-called rich countries must be given the possibility of introducing appropriate support measures in good time, especially in structurally weak regions bordering third countries.
I am voting in favour of this report because my Amendment No 1 opens up this possibility.
