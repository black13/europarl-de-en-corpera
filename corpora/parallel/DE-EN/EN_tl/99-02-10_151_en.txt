Mr President, I have two questions for the Council.
The first concerns the pre-accession aids.
Pre-accession aids are to be coordinated in the PHARE committee without, as it seems now, the presence of the applicant countries themselves.
To what extent can this kind of pre-accession strategy be described as being based on partnership?
My second question to the Council concerns the regional policy/Structural Fund component in the EU.
How much importance does the Council assign to the principles of partnership in the Structural Fund regulation, especially the participation of the environmental partners, the participation of the environmental NGOs, the participation of representatives of equal opportunities for women and of the social partners?
