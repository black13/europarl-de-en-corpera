Mr President-in-Office, we discovered yesterday evening that we agree to a very wide extent on the pre-accession funds.
Even though the Austrian Presidency already achieved a consensus, that is to say a consensus was already reached during the Austrian Presidency, I do of course have to ask again how far you can still take Parliament's decisions into consideration.
We saw positive steps in that direction yesterday, but I believe you should clarify once again whether there is in fact still any chance of movement here.
Let me also say a few words on the Structural Funds.
The current debate that centres on the need to stabilise expenditure and ensure fair burden-sharing is certainly right, but we in the European Union have another task before us which must always be given due consideration: it is the question of job creation.
Here I will take up the cudgels for the Structural Funds and for maintaining these policies as far as possible.
Structural aid is targeted at forward-looking development models and economic sectors which have the potential to create new employment opportunities.
Is the Council aware that we must set this as a priority?
Fighting unemployment and creating jobs is in fact the top priority, and this is reflected in Agenda 2000 too, where it is very strongly emphasised.
