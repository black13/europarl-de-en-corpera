Mr President-in-Office, may I cordially ask you not to forget that when you come here you are not a German minister, but the President-in-Office of the Council who speaks for the Council.
I have always spoken my mind to the gentlemen of the Council - and apart from once they have always been gentlemen - of whatever political persuasion they happen to be, without regard for party politics.
If I have a complaint to make against the Council, I will do so, and you are now representing the Council for six months.
Next time it will be a Finn, and I will not treat him with kid gloves any more than I do you.
You are here not as a German minister, but as President-in-Office of the Council, so please do not be so touchy and do tell your people back home that we are not attacking the Germans here, but the presidency!
