Mr President, the committee adopted this report by a large majority and I think it is the result of lengthy discussions.
It describes the pressures on island regions that are remote and isolated from the economic centre of the Union.
It points out that there are three different kinds of subregions, which must be consulted, must be involved in the decision-making; and here I believe the reference to new ACP negotiations is important.
The reference to trade, to the generalised system of preferences and to the need for a coherent policy is one of the key points of this report and a key to the future negotiations.
We should support the concrete demands set out in relation to telecommunications, research and development, education and training and the prevention of natural disasters.
I believe we all agree on the need for regional integration.
However, the use of the term 'Caribbean Europe' on page 11 of the report reflects both the problems that exist but also, in my view, a problem we have been carrying around with us since colonial days.
Would it not make sense to consider these three subregions together, to give them independence, to link them into a regional association through a new treaty and to help them in that endeavour, so that we can finally be through with this episode of old colonial history?
That is a thought and an idea worth considering, because I find this demand, and the very term 'Caribbean Europe', quite incomprehensible!
I am in Europe, I am in this economic area, I am in this trade area, which we want to shape and control democratically.
And the people of other regions want the same.
Do we not want to support regional developments?
Our resolve for the future should be to pursue this idea further!
