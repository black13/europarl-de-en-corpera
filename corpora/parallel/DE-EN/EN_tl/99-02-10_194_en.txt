Mr President, when I look at the globe and consider the regions we are discussing, it almost makes me feel dizzy to think about the problems around the world that we are tackling from here in Europe.
First and foremost we have special obligations towards the ACP states.
The rapporteur, whom I congratulate on his work, pointed out in his explanatory statement that developments in these regions, in the OCTs, are not particularly positive, in spite of favourable conditions.
I do not know whether we are taking the right approach to changing this situation.
On the one hand he proposes a range of administrative measures, on the other a range of financial measures.
I would like to see more emphasis put on the regional approach to which some previous speakers have repeatedly referred.
For I believe that is where the best chances lie for development, that we must exclude the long-distance approach from the outset and focus more on cooperation within these regions.
Although I am a member of the Committee on Development and Cooperation I still have a few problems with some of the paragraphs and sections of the report.
First there is the question of enhanced Union citizenship which it discusses; but that is after all tied to very definite conditions.
Then there is the question of a special fund under the Community budget.
Here I fear that we would to some extent be restricting ourselves, tying ourselves down and losing flexibility.
Thirdly, there is the idea of setting up offices or contact points in all these countries, which I also see as an added administrative burden without any obvious benefits.
