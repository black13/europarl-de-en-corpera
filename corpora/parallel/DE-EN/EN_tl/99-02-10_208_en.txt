Mr Perry, I fully sympathise with your concern.
But let me point out again that this matter comes under competition law.
We have definite legal bases for this within the European Union and the Commission is responsible for applying this law and implementing the regulations.
This matter has to be dealt with in the Commission and that is the appropriate procedure.
Let me repeat that the Council is prepared to consider the matter if the Commission puts the appropriate proposal before it.
