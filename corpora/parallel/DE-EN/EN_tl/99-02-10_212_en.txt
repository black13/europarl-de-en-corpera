Mr Lindqvist, we are fully aware of the problem.
I myself was informed of it in detail by the Swedish Government in Stockholm last Sunday.
Let me repeat that in addition to the Commission proposal there is another one that will be decided upon.
Only when it has been decided what funds will be available in future for structural aid in sparsely populated areas, and not just, as you rightly said, in Sweden and Finland, but also in other parts of the Union, can the decision be taken on the concrete shape of such a programme.
