Mr Bonde, I do not think I need tell you how the present system of the EU common agricultural policy came into being and how it has developed.
It is based on decisions that were taken in years gone by.
At this moment we are about to embark on a reform of European agricultural policy that is aimed at making agriculture in Europe more competitive, more productive, more sustainable and more ecologically acceptable.
The Commission's proposals to that effect are on the table and what I have just said holds true here: within the Council, the Member States have very different ideas about the final shape of the reform of agricultural policy.
Some Member States even think we should not make any changes at all.
I am expecting the Agriculture Council, which will be meeting from 22 to 24 February, to give us the first insight into the agriculture ministers' view of the future of European agricultural policy.
It is too soon to do so today.
I cannot answer this question today because the relevant decisions have not yet been taken.
