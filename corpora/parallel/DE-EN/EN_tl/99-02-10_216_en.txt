Mr Martin, I am happy to do what you say and draw the Council's attention to this fact.
You will not be surprised if I say that one Member State has already done so and is doing so very insistently, which means that the Council is very well aware of this problem.
I must add, however, that the deliberations to date show that a broad majority within the Council is in favour of an extremely strict application of the 75 % criterion for Objective 1 regions.
That is partly because there are of course also a number of areas that come just below that threshold and a few that are just above it.
The trend as I see it at present is to continue to apply this criterion strictly.
But the Council is fully aware of the problem.
I will see to it that Parliament's and your concerns are taken into account during the further deliberations.
