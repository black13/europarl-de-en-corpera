Mr President, Ms Oddy, the Council attaches great importance to the human rights activities of non-governmental organisations.
It pays great attention to the NGOs' opinions and recommendations and seeks contacts and exchanges of experience with them.
The same applies to the question of fleshing out the European Union's human rights policy.
In that respect let me point out that in December 1998 the then presidency of the Council distributed the Amnesty International report referred to by Ms Oddy to the CFSP Working Party on Human Rights.
The Council agrees with Amnesty International on the importance of seeking constantly to further improve EU human rights policy.
In that endeavour, the Council will also pay attention to Amnesty International's proposals.
The Council would refer you to the declaration published on 10 December 1998 on the occasion of the 50th Anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was subsequently confirmed by the European Council.
The declaration of 10 December contains a range of operative proposals and the Council will be discussing their formulation in the coming months.
On 25 January 1999 the General Affairs Council confirmed this.
The follow-up to the operative proposals in the declaration of 10 December 1998 forms an important part of the presidency's work programme.
It includes the question of an annual EU report on human rights.
The work programme also gives high priority to the endeavours to gain recognition of the EU's positions on human rights policy in relation to specific countries and issues in the framework of the United Nations.
That includes the important questions of the reform of the UN human rights mechanisms and preparations for the world racism conference.
