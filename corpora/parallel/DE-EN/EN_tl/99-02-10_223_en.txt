Mr President, at its meeting in Vienna the European Council reaffirmed the EU's solidarity with Russia and its people during the current economic crisis.
For that reason, on 17 December 1998 the Council adopted a comprehensive programme to supply agricultural produce to Russia.
Since 1991, ECHO has spent ECU 50 m on humanitarian aid for Russia.
A sum of ECU 4.8 m remains from the allocation for 1998.
After checking where the people were in greatest need, it was decided to concentrate on trying to resolve the problem of tuberculosis, especially in the prisons.
The Commission and the Council therefore entirely share the concerns expressed in the European Parliament's resolution of 19 November 1998 and the concerns voiced by Mr Provan.
With the new outbreaks of tuberculosis in the developing countries, prisons became the main breeding ground for this disease.
Russia has the highest rate of imprisonment in the world, 1 % of the total population.
Russian prisons are overcrowded.
In many penal institutions up to 10 % of inmates are infected.
That is why the Commission decided to use the lion's share of the ECU 4.8 m remaining from the 1998 budget, namely ECU 4.24 m, for projects to stem the tide of tuberculosis.
As you know, the ECHO aid is dealt with by NGOs in the EU, the United Nations agencies and international humanitarian organisations.
