Mr Provan, you have addressed a very grave problem and one which the Council in fact considered at length during a very serious debate.
Indeed we are facing the dilemma of on the one hand recognising a humanitarian obligation and wanting to help, while on the other we know that in the country we want to help we come up against structures that often stand in the way of achieving the purpose of the aid.
The Council has therefore laid down a political guideline for the Commission, to the effect that when these products are supplied to Russia, it must be ensured that they do indeed reach those who are in greatest need, that this does not disrupt any remaining food supply structures that still work and that it helps promote a viable policy for securing future food supplies to the people.
That was the Council's intention.
It has proved extremely difficult to apply these political conditions in relation to practical aid.
That is why I am persuaded that the Council will have to look into this whole issue again at once.
