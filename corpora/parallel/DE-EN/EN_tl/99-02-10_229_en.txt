Mr Dimitrakopoulos, the Council's principal demand to the Turkish side in Cyprus is that it should finally be willing to take part in the accession negotiations.
As you know, the European Union's political strategy here is to start the accession negotiations with Cyprus, in the hope that they can act as a catalyst to help resolve the political problem and in the end indeed resolve it.
So far this hope has not been fulfilled, but we still make the same very clear demand to the Turkish side to take part in the negotiations.
In any case, of course, we call on the Turkish side to keep a low military profile and to help defuse the situation by taking steps towards disarmament.
I cannot tell you anything about the possibility of Cyprus joining NATO, or about deliberations within NATO on the potential membership of Cyprus, since I represent the presidency of the European Union and not the NATO Council.
