Mr SÃ¡nchez-Neyra, the Council has not deliberated the matter to which you refer.
Nevertheless I can provide you with some information.
The Council reaffirms the position it adopted in regard to the agreements reached at the EU-USA summit in London in May 1998.
At that time the Council said that for legal reasons and reasons of principle it firmly rejected secondary boycotts and laws with extraterritorial and retroactive effect.
The Council welcomes the new measures taken by the US Government.
But even if they reflect a more flexible attitude on the part of the US towards Cuba, the Council regrets that the American embargo on Cuba remains in place.
Such actions are not the best means of promoting democracy and respect for human rights.
The Council still believes it right to seek a dialogue with Cuba, as we stated in the common position of December 1969, and to support a process of peaceful transition to a pluralist democracy, together with respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and sustained economic recovery in Cuba.
The EU still regards the implementation of the agreements of the EU-USA London summit of 18 May 1998 as a priority.
But in spite of the efforts of the US Government, to date there is still not the kind of progress that would lead the USA to radically review its sanctions policy.
