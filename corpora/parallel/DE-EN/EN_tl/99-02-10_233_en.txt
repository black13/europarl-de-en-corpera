Yes, Mr SÃ¡nchez-Neyra, the presidency does share the Commission's view on this question.
I cannot tell you anything about time-frames at this point because the Council has not taken a decision on this.
I personally think it should happen at the time of the EU-USA summit in June this year at the latest.
