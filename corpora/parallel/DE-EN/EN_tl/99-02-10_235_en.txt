Mrs González Álvarez, I am extremely grateful to you for that information and would in fact be most obliged to you if you could, as you say, put the relevant documents at the Council's disposal so that it can take account of them in the appropriate decision-making processes.
I would not like to make any political assessment at this moment, before actually seeing the documents.
I am sure you will understand that.
But this course of events you have just described ought also to be considered at the EU-USA summit in June at the latest.
