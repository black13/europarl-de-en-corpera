Mr President, Mr Sepp√§nen, under the Wassenaar Arrangement, cryptographical goods always were subject to export controls.
At their plenary meeting on 2 and 3 December 1998, the 33 contracting states of the Wassenaar Arrangement merely decided to review the rules on export controls for encryption techniques; these are known as cryptographical goods.
The aim was to relax the export controls and ensure that cryptographical restrictions did not become entrenched.
Those contracting states that are also EU Member States were particularly concerned to avoid any rules that would further restrict free trade.
It is true that the European Union as such is not a contracting party to the Wassenaar Arrangement.
At present there is an integrated system in which the Council, the Commission and the Member States exercise their respective responsibilities, with a view to protecting the Member States' fundamental security interests and fulfilling their international obligations.
The Council is currently preparing to implement the Wassenaar decisions.
To this end it will amend Council Decision 94/942/CFSP and adjust the list of dual-use goods subject to export controls pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 3381/94, which is the dual-use regulation in question.
The Council hopes the revised list can enter into force on 1 April 1999.
