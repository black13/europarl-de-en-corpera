Mr President, yes Mr Sepp√§nen, you understood me correctly.
Let me repeat: at the plenary meeting on 2 and 3 December the Wassenaar contracting states decided to review the export control rules on encryption techniques.
So these are the cryptographical goods you mentioned.
Under the new rules the export controls have been relaxed.
And that was precisely the aim of the EU Member States, namely to prevent cryptographical restrictions from being entrenched in these new rules.
