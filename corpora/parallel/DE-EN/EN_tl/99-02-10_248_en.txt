Mrs Ahern, in your supplementary you have linked two entirely different matters, which really have nothing to do with each other.
The current talks between the German and UK Governments on Sellafield have nothing to do with the decisions OSPAR took in Lisbon.
They are two entirely different matters.
There is no link between them.
I do not have any way of judging to what extent the operation of the plant to which you refer is or is not compatible with the provisions.
As I said, this autumn we will be receiving reports from the contracting states on what they propose to do in order to achieve the objectives laid down in Lisbon.
