Mr Hyland, obviously I cannot provide a timetable of this kind because the Council is not currently considering the question of bringing nuclear technology in Europe to an end or the question of when the reprocessing technology will come to an end in Europe.
That is a matter for deliberation in the Council.
As for the concern of the citizens, I believe that the Member States concerned should make these concerns known to the Council.
It cannot be the presidency's job to discuss a Member State's problems if that Member State itself does not wish it.
