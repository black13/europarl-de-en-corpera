Mr President-in-Office, I just want to ask whether this problem that is facing Greece is not also connected with two other issues.
One is the question of common measures to combat illegal immigration, the other is a fair distribution of the personnel burden as regards asylum applicants and other immigrants.
So long as no progress is made on these issues, I fear we will not have a common approach on other such issues either.
So my question is: on what is the Council focusing in this area in order to adopt a common approach on these two issues?
