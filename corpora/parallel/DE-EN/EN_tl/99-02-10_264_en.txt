Mr Posselt, as you know, we do indeed regard this as an important and fundamental issue.
But it is not directly linked to this very specific Greek problem.
I really cannot tell you how the immigrants from Rwanda, Sierra Leone and Myanmar actually get to Greece.
But the basic problem you have raised is one that is currently being discussed in depth in the Council, and the Council intends to cooperate more closely in this area and to take decisions and decide on joint action here at the latest by the time of the special summit to be held in Tampere in Finland during the next six-month presidency.
