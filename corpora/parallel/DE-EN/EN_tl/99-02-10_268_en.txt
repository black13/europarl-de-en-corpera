Mrs Malone, I would very much like to tell you what I think about this, because I really have very specific views, which I am sure are not very different from yours.
But as you know, I cannot do so.
All I can tell you at this point is that the Commission would have to check whether in the case you describe there was any infringement of the provisions on the use of Structural Fund resources.
It is up to the Commission to do this; the Council cannot do so.
Presumably today's Question Time will, as you hoped, raise European public awareness of this issue.
