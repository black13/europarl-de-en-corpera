Mr Hyland, the Council is aware that European tourism will be a very important industry in the next century.
On 6 June 1996 the Commission submitted a proposal for a decision on a first multiannual programme to promote European tourism.
The subject has been considered several times since then.
The Austrian Presidency took it up again and at its meeting of 7 December 1998 the Council once again considered the multiannual programme to promote European tourism on the basis of a document drawn up by the Austrian Presidency.
In spite of the presidency's proposal to shorten the duration of the programme and to reduce the budget funds allocated to it, some delegations continued to raise objections.
Let me point out that if no consensus is reached the German Presidency proposes the following: continuation of the work on this programme, taking account of the recommendations made by the High Level Group on Tourism and Employment, and renewed consideration of the subject in the light of new developments.
