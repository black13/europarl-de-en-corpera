Mr Hyland, I am sorry to have to tell you that there is no agreement in the Council on any of these questions.
On the contrary, there is much dispute about them.
Unfortunately my personal view in this regard is of no significance.
But you can guess what it is when I tell you that I myself represent a rural constituency in the German Bundestag.
Let me say again: the German Presidency will continue nonetheless to try very hard to achieve the consensus that is still lacking, and will certainly continue to keep the matter under consideration.
