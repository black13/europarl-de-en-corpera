Mr Theonas, it is for the British Government to react to the alleged statements by the UK government spokesman on Cyprus, Sir David Hannay.
He is the spokesman on Cyprus for the British Government and not for the European Union.
The presidency has information to the effect that Sir David Hannay's statements were misunderstood and that the British Government has now clarified the matter.
The presidency therefore sees no occasion to comment on these statements.
