Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when this House gave its assent to the third stage of monetary union on 2 May last year, many speakers maintained that this common currency would lead almost automatically to political union which, thanks to its own internal logic, would remove the imbalance between economic and political integration in Europe.
For those with the insight to realise it, that was a dangerous illusion even at that time.
I believe that today it is clear to us all that it was an illusion.
Anyone who thought the common currency must and would necessarily lead to a common economic policy, then to an employment policy and finally to a social union is now disappointed.
One employment summit after another has failed.
The economic players of European integration will not manage to create a political Europe: they cannot because many people are far too interested in creating a market Europe and not a political Europe.
