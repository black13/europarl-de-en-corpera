I reject this criticism.
The Council was perfectly well represented at this morning's sitting; it must be left to the Council to decide at what level it is represented.
I have nothing to add on the matter.
The document you quote does not refer specifically to any one applicant country but refers to all the applicant countries.
That means Cyprus in the same way as it does Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovenia and Estonia.
