Mrs McKenna, the Council has not been informed of the US Government plans referred to in your question.
Neither the European Union nor any its Member States are parties to the ABM Treaty.
But the US Government has declared that it intends to adhere to the core of the treaty and jointly discuss a modification to it with Russia.
Some Member States of the European Union are parties to the 1977 Convention on the Prohibition of Military or Any Other Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Techniques.
But to date this convention has not been discussed in the framework of the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy.
