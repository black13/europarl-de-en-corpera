Mr Killilea, I will give you an answer.
But I know in advance that you will see it as a non-answer because the Council has not received the report on the interaction between grey seals and fishing gear, which is, after all, the report you are referring to.
For this reason the Council cannot give its views on the report.
But I have been informed, Mr Killilea, that you have addressed a similar question to the Commission.
I believe the Commission is more likely to be in a position to give you a satisfactory answer.
