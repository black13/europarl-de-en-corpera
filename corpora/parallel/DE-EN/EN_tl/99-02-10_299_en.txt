Mr Killilea, since I too have experience of the lengthy procedures in this House I fully understand your problem.
I do not quite know whether I should support the seals, the fish or the people.
I would advise the Irish Government to bring the matter up again if as you say - and I do not doubt your words - it is important to the people of the west coast of Ireland.
The Council cannot take the initiative to discuss a report by an Irish authority or to take a position when the report has not even been submitted to it.
My advice would be, if the Commission cannot give you an answer either, that the Irish Government itself should raise this matter in Brussels.
