Mr President, in discussing the water framework directive tonight, we are unfortunately talking not about water protection but about a piecemeal policy.
The proposal makes that clear.
There are too many exceptions, no clear limit values and standards, quality targets that are in no way binding, that follow the English principle of: let's water it down and nobody will notice.
Then there are the excessively long transition periods of up to 34 years, which make it clear that water protection is basically being postponed to some never-never day.
That makes a mockery of consumer protection.
But for me the worst of all, the ecological Waterloo, is the question of the discharge of hazardous substances.
In spite of the OSPAR convention, this quasi-common position proposes that nothing, nothing at all should be done.
I believe we must realise that water is too precious a resource to be used as a rubbish dump.
In that regard I expect us to give a very clear signal during the vote tomorrow.
I also hope that we will reach agreement tomorrow on setting limit values for radioactivity, as we did in the case of the drinking water directive ...
The President cut the speaker off
