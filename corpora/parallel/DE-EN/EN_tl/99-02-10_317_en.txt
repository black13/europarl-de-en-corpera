Mr President, this directive had a difficult birth.
On behalf of our colleagues let me after the event thank all those who played a constructive part in the work, including of course our rapporteur, Mr White, but also the Commission, which has showed signs of flexibility.
I expect the German Presidency to scrutinise Parliament's work carefully, otherwise there could be a bad surprise in store for it at the second reading in the European Parliament, in the form of rejection.
As rapporteur on the groundwater action programme, which is another extremely important area, I regard the following requirement as essential: to lay down comprehensive groundwater protection measures, ban direct discharges of harmful substances and, linked to that, not to lay down limit values for groundwater, to preempt what is called the watering down effect, and finally to remove and prevent where possible what are called indirect discharges into groundwater and of course to clean up polluted groundwater as far as possible by technical means.
Three of my amendments serve those goals.
Let me point out again that I am particularly concerned with Amendment No 77 and do not accept the compromise amendment.
I would warn against making exaggerated, unrealistic and impractical demands.
Even if environmental protection has in the past had a raw deal in many other policy areas and too little attention has been paid to it, we must not repeat the same mistake by going too far in the opposite direction.
That is why I and my group are firmly opposed to certain amendments, some of which are simply not feasible, either for financial reasons or because we do not have the available technical resources.
Legislation that called for too much would not be credible.
Let me conclude with a question to the Commission.
What is happening with the draft directive on ecological water quality?
If the Commission has officially withdrawn that proposal, I am not aware of it.
