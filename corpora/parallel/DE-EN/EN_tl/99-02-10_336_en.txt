I hope we do not drop the idea of the insurance certificate, for otherwise liability would be pointless.
People would think we were mad if we said tomorrow that drivers were allowed to take their cars on the road without an insurance certificate.
It would be even more senseless in the case of a risk technology to call only for liability without making it compulsory to have insurance.
I hope that tomorrow's vote will be the proof, indeed the acid test, that the European Parliament can assume responsibility.
I was also pleased by the call just now for Member States to be able to apply moratoria.
We tabled an amendment to precisely that effect in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, but unfortunately it was in vain.
We hope you will be able to approve it tomorrow.
I hope tomorrow we will send out a signal that we take the alarming scientific findings seriously.
A simplified procedure is irresponsible, as is Category I and the majority-state procedure.
But what I regard as the ultimate irresponsibility is a 12-year consent period for doubtful cases.
That is pure cynicism, for surely it means that we are using man and nature as a form of guinea-pig!
We believe it is vital to ban antibiotic-resistant genes, for otherwise we are heading for a therapeutic disaster, and to ensure that high-risk plants, i.e. those that can cross over to others, really must not be allowed to spread ...
