Mr President, on the 12-year question: the committee called for a 12-year time-limit where there are safety doubts.
I am surprised to hear Mr Liese applauding, for it would be cynical of me to say: I shall put products on the market which I know in advance are doubtful.
That would be turning man and nature into guinea-pigs.
What we would have liked to see are monitoring programmes before the seven years are up, i.e. a fixed time-limit but with monitoring programmes that start before that date.
We tabled several other amendments in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, doing so in three different ways in regard to the moratorium for release.
The Group of the Party of European Socialists rejected them.
We have now tabled Amendment No 77, which reverses the burden of proof by saying that the Commission must provide proof to the contrary.
