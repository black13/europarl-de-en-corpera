Mr President, I find it unacceptable that the Commissioner has been coming here for the past six years and announcing that a White Paper on liability is imminent.
We debated Directive No 90/219 exactly a year ago.
There too we called for the introduction of liability.
The Commissioner said there would be a White Paper in a few weeks' time.
But a White Paper is not a directive.
Six years have passed since the Green Paper.
Commissioner, I think what you are doing here is gradually becoming an insult to our intelligence!
You refuse liability by stalling us for six years with a horizontal directive
I would now like you to tell us exactly why you keep lying to us and in particular why you said there would be a White Paper in a few weeks' time and why you are stalling us again now.
Even then we would still be far from having a directive.
That means it would still take years.
Where, I ask myself, is the own responsibility of industry and science?
I find it totally irresponsible and no longer acceptable for you to stall us like this!
