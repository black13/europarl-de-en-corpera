Mr President, I am asking for the floor because I was personally addressed and attacked in the last but one statement by Mrs Breyer and if she is given the floor again this must be clarified.
She said that because we are in favour of an optional time-limit that means we regard people as guinea-pigs.
That really is absurd.
The fact is that the Commission evidently sees a need for introducing a time-limit.
We say there need to be scientific grounds for doing so.
If there are scientific grounds, then it should be done; so it has nothing to do with guinea-pigs.
For there are some areas where no such grounds exists, where no scientific reasons can be found for setting a time-limit, and that is the issue.
The issue has nothing at all to do with guinea-pigs or whatever but concerns a procedure that is commensurate with the risk!
