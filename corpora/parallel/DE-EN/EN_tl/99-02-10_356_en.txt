Mr President, this proposal for a directive is a stroke of luck for the environment, since assigning responsibility to the manufacturer was long overdue and it was also high time waste prevention applied to the motor vehicle sector too.
I am glad the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection also stood up for freedom of charge to the last user.
I very much regret that Mr Florenz has expressed his personal view here rather than that of the Environment Committee.
I hope that tomorrow Members will also stand by their amendment on banning PVC from the year 2005.
I find it shocking to hear that there are obviously plans to bow to the PVC industry here tomorrow!
And let me tell Mrs GrossetÃªte and others that we are not talking about banning plastic.
We are talking about banning PVC, about products involving chlorine.
There is actually a bioplastic and other plastic materials.
The argument she put forward was quite absurd and I must say that unfortunately that shows that she was not well-informed and that obviously this is merely a question of arguments ...
The President cut the speaker off
