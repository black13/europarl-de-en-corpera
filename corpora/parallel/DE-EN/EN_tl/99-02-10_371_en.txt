Mr President, perhaps we have not done very well with the banana regime we have adopted in Europe.
But to react to that by immediately declaring war, by imposing a 100 % duty on candles, weapons, pullovers and suchlike, is not, in my view, the right answer.
It is the old method of trying to get your way by might and main that was used in the wars of the past.
The winner is the one who can shoot most people dead.
We have learned a lot more since then in Europe.
Basically it is a question of finding a better solution.
That means if we have two different points of view, we should acknowledge that both sides could be right.
Then we should try to meet each other halfway and say, let us not just accept solution 1 or 2, let us also try solution 3, 4, 5, 10 or 15 and go on until we find a solution that everyone can accept; and these solutions must be worked out at a high official level.
