Mr President, reforming the Council is probably the most difficult task of all.
In practice it simply means calling on the Council to reform itself.
So I am not surprised to find it was not even present to listen to this appeal and that it seems to be fairly indifferent to Parliament's reform project.
The Council is the Achilles heel of European democracy, if not the black hole.
That is because of its amphibious nature.
As a European institution it is constantly distancing itself from the national parliaments and the national and European courts.
It is constantly distancing itself from the European Parliament by presenting itself as a meeting of the Member States.
That is why I do not have any real hope that this black hole of democracy can be closed, that we will finally see open legislation, majority decisions, the democratisation of the second and third pillar.
This kind of governmental cooperation is increasingly becoming a democratic no man's land.
I congratulate the rapporteur on his attempts to at least sketch out the broad lines of reform here.
I also congratulate him on the clever way in which he proposed a revolutionary shift of power in favour of the large states while presenting this as maintaining the existing balance.
That is a particularly successful intellectual proposal.
