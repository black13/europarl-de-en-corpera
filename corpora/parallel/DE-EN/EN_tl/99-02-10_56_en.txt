Mr President, the Bourlanges report is excellent, as was only to be expected.
For many years Jean-Louis Bourlanges has spearheaded the process of European integration.
Looking at him, though, perhaps he is not quite as pointed as a spearhead.
But the Bourlanges report is also an important one.
For it reminds us in good time that the Union is constantly facing two tasks: enlargement and deepening.
We have spoken a great deal about enlargement over the past months.
And we have repeatedly and rightly referred to the homework the applicant countries must do.
Let me remind you, for instance, of the debate in this House prior to the Vienna summit.
At the same time we must not forget to do our own homework here in this House and here in the Union.
The European Union must remain able to act, or to be more precise, become more able to act.
Amsterdam has brought some progress in this area, but the opportunity for progress at the last minute was clearly not taken.
In particular, the important questions of decision-making in the Council have remained open.
The Bourlanges report considers these questions and seeks constructive, forward-looking solutions to them.
By and large, I believe it has done so with great success, as many of the previous speakers have pointed out and emphasised.
I believe there are still some question marks in regard to certain parts of the call - however right in principle - for the general introduction of majority voting in the Council.
I am particularly sceptical about paragraphs 28, 32 and 33 concerning own resources and qualified majority voting.
Let me address a last point that was rightly raised in an amendment tabled by Mr Saint-Pierre.
We must also consider the method of the next treaty reform, and here it is the Community method that is the right one, not the intergovernmental conference method, which is governed only by the power of veto.
