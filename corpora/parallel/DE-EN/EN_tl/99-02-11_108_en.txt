Madam President, may I make an initial remark outside my allotted speaking time.
At our last part-session, we said that the presidency of the Council should attend these debates.
It would be good if that were the case, but unfortunately I see nobody from the presidency.
Perhaps you could arrange that for next time through the Bureau.
On the border between Ethiopa and Eritrea, serious conflicts occurred between those two countries in May and June of last year.
There were battles in which thousands died; in June 1998 a moratorium was signed, but hostilities have broken out again.
We have a frontier conflict here which the population certainly does not want.
International conciliation efforts appear to have failed.
Nevertheless, we should not stop trying to achieve peace in that region, because peace will never be achieved there by military means.
It is right to say that we shall have to exert pressure on both countries.
That is why it is also right to threaten them with suspension of support under the Lom√© Convention and of development aid from the European Union and its Member States.
But this pressure may not be enough.
Perhaps it would also be important and appropriate - and we saw this when we met the two ambassadors in the Committee on Development and Cooperation and in the Executive of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly - for us to draw up a development plan, subject to both sides withdrawing their military hardware, to their showing willingness to negotiate, and to their being prepared to develop democracy and the rule of law and to grant reciprocal inspection rights.
We would then deliver a development plan and would step up the current level of development aid as an initial measure.
