Madam President, the European Parliament has always rejected the death penalty outright on humanitarian grounds.
Once again, circumstances compel us to appeal to the government of a civilised nation, the United States of America, not to carry out a death sentence.
This time we are appealing on behalf of Greg Summers.
He has always protested his innocence.
There are doubts as to whether the trial was properly conducted.
An appeal was lodged with the competent court in Texas, and there has still been no response to it.
For that reason, our first request to the United States and the State of Texas is that this appeal should be considered.
Secondly, we call on them to refrain in principle from carrying out death sentences, commuting them instead to life imprisonment or other custodial sentences.
Thirdly, we call for them to join in a worldwide moratorium on the death penalty, and we call on the institutions of the EU to pass this on to the relevant authorities.
Let me turn to our group's amendments on two cases involving Germans - the brothers Karl and Walter LaGrand, who have been sentenced to death in Arizona.
This would be the first time since the Second World War that Germans were sentenced to death and executed.
We call on the United States not to carry out their death sentences, and we hope that these amendments will be incorporated into today's resolution.
In both cases, we propose that the death sentences be commuted to life imprisonment or another appropriate custodial sentence.
