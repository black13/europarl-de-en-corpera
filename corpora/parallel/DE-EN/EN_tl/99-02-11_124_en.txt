Madam President, half an hour ago, in the discussion on Kazakhstan, I said that we should not go around teaching the world how to behave.
This time, however, it is quite a different matter, because we are now dealing with those who constantly seek to lecture us, as Mr Habsburg-Lothringen was saying before.
In other words, we do have the right in this instance to say that things simply cannot go on like this.
The whole process, which I have studied very closely, raises all sorts of doubts.
Not a single piece of conclusive evidence was brought against Peltier.
The way in which the American judiciary dispensed so-called justice in this case is simply indefensible for a highly civilised country.
We should therefore point out to our American friends, to whom, of course, we owe a huge debt of gratitude, that something has to be done about Peltier.
To deprive a person of 23 years of his life, to cast an Indian into prison and give him no opportunities to move about, to give him literally not a single moment of freedom and to leave him languishing in uncertainty is utterly indefensible.
Having followed the history of the Peltier case, I would almost make so bold as to say that, even if he had done something, which I do not believe, he would already have paid twice over for everything that happened.
If we are convinced that he is innocent into the bargain, that is all the more reason for us to make every effort to ensure that the Americans make justice prevail in their country too - and if not justice, then at least clemency.
