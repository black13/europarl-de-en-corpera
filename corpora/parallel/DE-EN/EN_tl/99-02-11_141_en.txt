Mr President, the acts of violence in the West African State of Guinea-Bissau are causing us serious concern.
President Jean Bernardo Vieira and General Ansumane Man√© concluded a peace agreement in Abuja on 1 November 1998, and it is absolutely essential that they observe the terms of that agreement.
The Council and the Commission must insist on that.
The agreement requires the withdrawal of foreign troops, especially from Senegal and the Republic of Guinea.
Here too, it is up to the Council and Commission to exert pressure.
The deployment of ECOMOG troops was requested, permitted and wanted.
The peacekeeping forces of the Economic Community of West African States are essential as guarantors of the peace.
Since 3 February another cease-fire has been in force.
We support the territorial integrity of the country, or so I believe.
We call on the government to reform itself into a government of national unity.
If that is done, the Commission should then provide appropriate aid, since thousands of people have fled their homes.
Refugees are being produced here, and famine is being produced here.
We should also mention that much of the misery has been caused by weapons from Western Europe.
The politicians and the armed forces must abide by the terms of the peace agreement.
If they do not do that, they are irresponsible, uncaring and blind to the lessons of history.
They must observe international law and human rights.
Their observance of international law and human rights is the basis on which we can provide humanitarian aid and support ECOMOG through the Council and the Commission.
I believe that would be a strategy for underpinning the peace.
It is up to the two sides in Guinea-Bissau.
