Mr President, everyday life in Colombia is grim.
Every month we could discuss the latest human rights violations, the paramilitaries, attacks on the Indios and the black population, people driven from their homes and the disappearance of individuals.
This time, however, the cause of our concern is what we call a natural disaster, namely the earthquake in the city of Armenia.
It has heaped untold suffering on the population, and I do not propose to repeat everything my honourable colleagues have already said on the subject.
Nevertheless, the natural disaster has been compounded by a home-made disaster in the form of corruption and incompetence, partly within the Colombian government apparatus, which are hindering the effort to ensure that help reaches the victims and reaches them quickly.
We must be particularly worried by reports that the allegedly rapid assistance provided by the European Union has failed to arrive in many places.
There is an urgent need to find out how accurate this information is.
An official report on this matter is urgently required.
In the wake of the earthquake, the paramilitaries have launched a campaign to annihilate human rights activists.
Politicians and others at home and abroad insist that it is high time President Andr√©s Pastrana took decisive action.
Alas, we have seen too little of that.
Here too, there is an urgent need for the Commission to demand that the Colombian Government act to stamp out these violations of human rights in the aftermath of the earthquake.
