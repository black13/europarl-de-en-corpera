Mr President, I congratulate the House on its unanimous adoption of the resolution on Kazakhstan.
I have the German version in front of me.
It consists only of the following phrase: 'beauftragt seinen Präsidenten, diese Entschließung an die und die weiterzuleiten ' (instructs its President to forward this resolution to such-and-such).
The only other thing on this sheet is two straight lines.
I just wanted to ask whether others have read the resolution and whether their versions contain the text.
