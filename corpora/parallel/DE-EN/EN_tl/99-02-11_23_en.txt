Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, people in civilised societies do not relieve themselves in the street.
The requirement that ships discharge their waste in port follows the same elementary logic.
I believe that Mr Lagendijk's report makes that perfectly clear.
There must be no incentive, such as the avoidance of special fees, to circumvent that requirement.
There must be a 50 % inspection rate.
Anything else will give rise to absurd or dangerous situations, and the system must be weighted in favour of environmentally friendly vessels.
Basically, this report pussyfoots its way indirectly towards addressing three key points.
The first is the question of a European maritime regulatory area.
The United States has had one for a long time.
The European Union continues to act as if it were a patchwork of small states, between which only the IMO standards apply.
That is an indefensible state of affairs.
The second point is the need for control by the port state.
This is an imperative of the first order, given the development of flags of convenience and dual registration.
The third point is the primacy of ecology, since the destruction of our vital resources is certainly no basis on which to develop an economic activity.
