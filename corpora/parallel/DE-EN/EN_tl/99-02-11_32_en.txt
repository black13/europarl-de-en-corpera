Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a word of thanks first of all to Mr van Dam, who stepped into the breach for Florus Wijsenbeek, who for very honourable reasons handed back the report.
If I sense the mood correctly, the House will reject the report when it is put to the vote or at a subsequent stage, and with good reason too.
But why?
After all, we agree on the aim of promoting combined transport, because we want to see the transport of goods shifted from the roads to the railways and waterways.
So we agree on the aim.
The question is whether the solution proposed here by the Commission is a suitable means to that end.
I believe it is an unsuitable means; I believe it is counter-productive.
When the Commission proposes in Article 9a that goods vehicles be exempted from all restrictions on traffic movements that may be applicable at weekends, at night, on public holidays or in the event of heavy atmospheric pollution, provided they constitute combined transport within the meaning of Article 1, this would open a Pandora's box, which we cannot endorse.
In other words, as well as the 44-tonne trailer combination that we have consistently rejected in Parliament, another adverse development is being permitted here, allowing almost anything to run on our roads as long as it operates in the name of combined transport.
That cannot be our line.
We are willing to negotiate about precise times and routes in this Parliament too, but this blanket clause, this carte blanche , cannot be in our interests.
It is the wrong way to proceed.
That is why the Commission must think again on this in order to come up with a better proposal.
