Mr President, I voted against this, because despite two major successes, namely the ban on marketing those genes that can be made untraceable and the fact that we managed to insist on a certificate of liability insurance, the text on which the House decided at the end of the day is worse than bad.
It represents the demolition of environmental and safety standards.
We have even backtracked from the Commission's stance.
The fact that we want to limit the marketing of products to a fixed period where there is inadequate monitoring experience relating to the marketing of comparable organisms effectively means that human beings and their environment are being used as guinea pigs, because if there is not enough experience available, these products should not be put on the market at all.
And we have no right to say that they can be marketed for a fixed period.
This is tantamount to saying that we shall see what has happened after twelve years, and only then will we draw the necessary conclusions.
That, I believe, is utterly irresponsible, just like the simplified procedure, the procedure for simultaneous release in several Member States and the Category I classification, because all these organisms fall under Category I. This means in effect that an environmental risk assessment is virtually ruled out.
I find this more than deplorable, along with the fact that no scope has been created for more stringent labelling.
This makes it obvious that we have bowed the knee to industrial interests here.
We shall see what the Council makes of it, and whether we can still pull the fat out of the fire together and initiate something that will really take us forward.
I also hope that industry will finally get down to discussing the risks and that the insurance business stands by what it has said, namely that the risk is too great for it to cover.
