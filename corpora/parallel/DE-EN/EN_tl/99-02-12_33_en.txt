Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it has clearly emerged during our discussion here that this is an impossible state of affairs.
Just because the ladies and gentlemen who head our states and governments - all gentlemen, as it so happens - are to gather for a meeting, they take it for granted that this Parliament will alter its schedule to accommodate them.
That is unacceptable!
Applause
Just imagine that a national government - and as a German, I am naturally aware that my country is currently presiding over the Council, but that is not my point; the identity of the government is irrelevant - decided to hold a cabinet meeting and expected the national parliament to alter its schedule.
That would be an intolerable state of affairs, which is why I say that the European Parliament should not take this lying down.
Applause
