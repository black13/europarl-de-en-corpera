Madam President, I shall be brief.
The report and even the title of the report are certainly broader, or at least cover more types of taxes and public charges, than may appear from your documentation.
The effects on incomes are clearly formulated in the Commission proposals.
All I was criticising was the fact that they do not feature in the title too, because I consider them to be important.
