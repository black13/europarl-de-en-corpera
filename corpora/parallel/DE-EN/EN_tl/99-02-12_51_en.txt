Madam President, I should like to convey my special thanks to Professor Bardong for his excellent work on an insoluble problem.
The report, which has been criticised in some points, such as the inconsistency between its title and its content, shows quite precisely the real sort of jungle in which we find ourselves.
I should like to say a few words on that.
There have been repeated references in this discussion to tax havens or, as we call them in German, 'tax oases'.
Let us consider what that expression means.
Where do we find oases?
In the desert, of course.
This means that when we speak of tax oases, we have to admit that everything in this landscape that is not an oasis is a desert.
That is the very nub of this entire discussion.
Our difficulties derive from the build-up of bureaucracies and technocratic measures; above all, they are indicative of the way in which our whole tax system is becoming increasingly complex and incomprehensible.
In that respect the report is truly excellent, and I shall vote for it, because it is technically correct and shows us precisely where the problem lies, namely in the fact that in the individual states, but also to some extent in the Union as a whole, the situation is becoming ever more complex for our citizens, which naturally gives crooks the opportunity to exploit that complexity.
I should like to see us addressing that problem very seriously, because if we do not establish a clear picture here, if we cannot adopt and implement simple solutions, we shall continue to have the same problems.
