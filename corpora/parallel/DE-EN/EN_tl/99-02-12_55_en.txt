Madam President, this is indeed a very important report.
I have to say that I am not a member of the Committee on Budgetary Control, but I am certainly rather confused after everything I have heard.
Now I must ask Mr Bangemann this question: if the system is extended, can it happen that, for instance in the case of value-added tax, excise duty ? well, just give us some examples of charges that might be covered here.
If we were then to have a withholding tax on interest and dividends - which heaven forbid - what would the situation be with regard to recovery by one country on behalf of another?
Please tell us what this monstrous title covers.
I am not at all sure any more whether I can support this proposal.
