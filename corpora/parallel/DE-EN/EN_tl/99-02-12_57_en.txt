Madam President, I shall answer any question from Mrs Lulling, since she voted in favour of the Commission.
Laughter
I shall also answer questions from the Members of Parliament who voted against the Commission, though somewhat more briefly!
Well, Mrs Lulling, the areas covered by the draft directive are indicated in the proposal.
Claims for value-added tax can certainly be subject to the recovery procedure.
It is indeed possible, and the proposal refers explicitly to that possibility.
At the present time, of course, we cannot include a reference to a withholding tax on interest and dividends, because it does not exist.
Should such a tax be introduced, a separate provision on its recovery would have to be inserted, because that type of tax is not covered by the proposed legislation.
Since there is no withholding tax on interest and dividends, there are no provisions for its recovery.
Should it be introduced - against your ardent wishes, which are naturally inspired by your concern for the future of Europe and for justice and are totally unconnected to the situation in your own Member State - the directive would have to be supplemented so that any outstanding amounts of withholding tax could be recovered.
