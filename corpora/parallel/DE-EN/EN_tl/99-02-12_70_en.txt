Mr President, first of all may I thank the rapporteur for his report, and above all for his critical approach to the Commission communication.
We are constantly talking in Parliament - and not just here, but in international organisations in general - about globalisation.
This report brings home to us the fact that this concept of globalisation is not always appropriate.
The fact is that we cannot even manage to establish a proper order and structure in our immediate vicinity which is beneficial to a body like the European Union in matters that concern its immediate sphere of interest.
In talking of the Mediterranean region, I think we must of course look too at its common history.
We should not forget that the Mediterranean was once really an inland sea in Europe and only later became Europe's southern frontier.
This common history means that the goals we have set ourselves, such as the creation of a free trade area by the year 2010, should really be perfectly feasible if the necessary infrastructure can be put in place, if it is possible to do that.
Inadequate infrastructure, especially in transport and telecommunications, is the main barrier to the development of this area's foreign and interregional trade.
I think it is most important to look at transport not just for the states immediately bordering on the Mediterranean but for the region as a whole, including the various Balkan states.
These countries must be included, and they must be included in a report of this kind.
I think a critical eye is important and necessary to ensure that this debate, this support and also the involvement of Parliament continue, and that communication between Commission and Parliament also continues in future to help bring about progress in this region.
