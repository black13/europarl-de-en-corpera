Mr President, following approval of the communication being debated here today, the recommended working party has already been set up.
The programme has been drawn up, so we have made a fair amount of progress.
We shall of course monitor the work of this forum and make suggestions in the context of the priorities set at the Barcelona conference.
We do not need to change those.
For example, environmental measures too have already been dealt with there as a priority.
We shall also - and this is the other matter arising from the debate - support and prepare the first meeting of the forum to be held in Malta on 23 and 24 March.
The European Parliament will be fully briefed on this.
All the texts presented and adopted there will be published.
Here too, there is already a clear emphasis on environmental activities.
So I think that we are currently well advanced with our efforts and have no need to fear a lack of success.
Of course - and that is really the problem with all this work, and with industrial cooperation too - success depends not only on our goodwill, but on that of our partner countries as well.
This goodwill on the part of our partner countries is certainly there, but to varying degrees.
Some partner countries in the Mediterranean area will certainly react very positively to all these activities.
Others would like to, but for a wide variety of reasons cannot, so we shall probably have to reconcile ourselves to a variety of results.
But that is not down to us, it is down to the partner countries themselves.
We in any case will do everything necessary to ensure a successful outcome.
