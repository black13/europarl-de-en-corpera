Mr President, anyone who is seriously concerned about education and training, about mobility and therefore about giving the young people of Europe greater opportunities on the labour market must also be most concerned about Socrates II.
Unfortunately the Council and Parliament have not yet managed to reach agreement on the amount of funding.
Since the duration of Socrates is being extended to seven years, it is only logical to call for EUR 2.5 billion for this programme.
Socrates must also be evaluated in both qualitative and financial terms by 31 December 2002.
I support Doris Pack's proposals in every respect and hope they will be taken into account.
Promoting linguistic knowledge, learning two foreign languages, of which at least one should be the language of a neighbouring country, is a vital means of giving our young people the chance to obtain qualifications, to make use of the single market, to find work and to develop a sense of Europe.
I also fully support the proposal to change the way grants are awarded to ensure that people do not all automatically receive grants that are barely enough to keep body and soul together.
Those who need the money should be given adequate grants.
I hope these points will be accepted and that the Conciliation Committee reaches a satisfactory conclusion before the end of this legislative term.
