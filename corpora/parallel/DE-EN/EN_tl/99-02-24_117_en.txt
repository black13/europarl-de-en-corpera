Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to ask the Commission why tobacco growing is still being supported to the tune of one billion euros, and in particular why lower-quality tobacco is supported rather than the high-quality varieties which are less damaging to health.
And now moves are afoot, in the form of Amendments Nos 2, 5 and 6, to make marketing even more difficult by adding 30 % to prices, which would further increase the incentive to engage in smuggling and line the pockets of those responsible for transit fraud.
I also believe that arbitrary censorship of tobacco advertising is a disaster in terms of health policy.
What we need in tobacco advertising is rational, explanatory, quality-orientated information.
If a blanket ban is imposed on advertising, there will be no means of advising consumers on their best course of action.
I believe it quite simply represents a lost opportunity to educate smokers in the use of better-quality tobacco as a health protection measure.
This arbitrary censorship scheme simply must be scrapped.
We must be given the opportunity to advertise in a way that focuses on health, and in a way that can prevent young people from taking up smoking at an excessively early age.
Perhaps the focus should be on sheer enjoyment and on moderation, to combat chain-smoking, and if some people smoke the odd cigarette for enjoyment, they should not be immediately subjected to social sanctions.
Tobacco is a legal product, a highly taxed product, and I believe it is inappropriate to ban the advertising of such a product.
