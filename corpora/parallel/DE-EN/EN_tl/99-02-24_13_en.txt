Mr President, I have a comment, or rather a request, to make to you about page 7 of the German version of the Minutes of the sitting of 12 February 1999.
In the point of order recorded in it, I said that the expected Wise Men's report should also be referred to the Committee on Budgetary Control.
Let me ask you to forward this report to us officially for our committee meeting on 15 and 16 March.
We need it for consultation, we need it so that we can, if necessary, consider it in the light of the discharge procedures that are still pending.
I said that this committee is the right forum for deciding the appropriate steps to take.
The report is quite clearly of great relevance to our committee.
So I would ask you to ensure that we receive the documents in good time for our meeting.
Applause
