Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, it is indeed an astonishing fact that our global players sometimes perform like teams in the lower reaches of the Third Division!
Here we have international groups and their industrial lobby actually trying to dissuade us from including a grace period in the patent laws.
And the groups of companies that are trying to dissuade us from affording protection to inventors are the very ones that are coping very comfortably with such provisions in other parts of the world, such as the United States or Japan.
Unlike the lobby, which condemns the grace period as hostile to research and a barrier to investment, I share the view of the rapporteur that European patent law cannot go on operating without the speedy introduction of a grace period.
It nurtures research and protects small and medium-sized businesses, to which the European Parliament is very committed, and with good reason, since these businesses create jobs that are urgently needed and are the channels through which the technologies of the future are introduced.
The ideas of young researchers at universities and research institutes provide the vital spark.
They must be able to discuss and publicise their innovations without jeopardising their right to apply for a potentially profitable patent.
Large companies can afford to conduct research behind closed doors and to keep new developments under wraps until the time is right to profit from them in the market-place.
Researchers at universities, on the other hand, must be able to publish their findings in order to establish and confirm their academic credentials.
The usefulness of the grace period can be seen in the United States.
That is where the most frequently cited researchers live, in a country with an enviable wealth of innovative small businesses.
If we want to compete with them, Europe will have to wake up - not gradually but as quickly as possible - whether or not it suits the large industrial groups.
