Mr President, the rapporteur attaches particular importance to the need to promote innovation in small and medium-sized enterprises.
He has hit the nail on the head there, because the large combines negotiate directly with the research centres in any event.
Small and medium-sized businesses are essentially in a difficult position.
Our prime concern is to encourage innovation in those companies which are not large enough to devote time, money and human resources to deal systematically, and primarily on their own initiative, with innovative developments.
It is a question of creating a real innovation culture among SMEs with a view to making European business competitive and safeguarding jobs.
Any initiatives that will help to achieve this goal, especially those which encourage young entrepreneurs to invest in innovation, are particularly welcome.
The most efficient approach would be to ensure that the largest possible slice of the budget for both the framework R&D programme and the Structural Funds is devoted to this aim.
