Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, beverages provide us with some of our nutrition.
In my home state of Bavaria, we came to the conclusion back in the 15th century that the consumer also needed to know that his beer was brewed in accordance with precise rules, since beer, after all, is a significant part of the Bavarian diet.
There are naturally other drinks as well.
Doctors are now recommending that we consume at least three litres of liquid every day, and consumers have a wide range to choose from.
However, it is important for them to know the quality that is available on the shelves.
I do not believe that consumers would ever enquire whether a beverage comes under the common organisation of agricultural markets or under other areas of the single market.
What they need is information that will help them to choose the right product.
I am thinking of people who have perhaps already consumed too much alcohol and should not therefore drink any more, but this is also about people with diabetes, for example, who need to know how much residual sugar a beverage contains.
These are all very important things nowadays, and I believe we need legislation that takes account of today's world and not only prescribes that beer and cider should be displayed in the opposite corner of the shop from wine, but actually provides us with a realistic legal basis.
I only wish to appeal to reason.
I believe that Mr Schnellhardt's report provides a rational basis, and I should be pleased if Parliament endorsed the material that Mr Schnellhardt has prepared.
