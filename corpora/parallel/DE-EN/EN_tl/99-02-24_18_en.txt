Mr President, pursuant to Rule 129 of the Rules of Procedure, the Green Group requests referral back to committee of the GrossetÃªte report.
I would justify this as follows.
I believe we should not vote on reports that have already passed their sell-by date.
The Commission is already working on a new proposal and has also spoken to a number of MEPs and made it quite clear that a completely revised version now exists.
I do not think there is much point voting on a report that is totally out of date.
I also think it would make us look a little ridiculous.
There is enough other work to be done without embarking on this kind of Sisyphean task.
So I would ask for this report to be referred back to committee.
You need only ask the Commission, which will confirm that a new draft will be available in the very near future and that there is little point deciding on a report that is already out of date.
