Mr President, I do not think you are proceeding entirely correctly.
Rule 129 states quite clearly: 'may be requested ... when the agenda is fixed or before the start of the debate'.
We have not yet started the debate and, if I have understood you correctly, we have just fixed the agenda.
Let me also point out that at its last meeting the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy actually asked for this item not to be included on the agenda because of the new Commission proposal.
So let me urgently repeat my request - and you are welcome to give the Commission the floor again.
After all it really is outrageous for us to debate a totally obsolete report.
So I urgently ask you to put this motion to the vote!
