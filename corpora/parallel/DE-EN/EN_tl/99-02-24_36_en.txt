Madam President, when crises flare up, as they did after the arrest of the PKK leader Öcalan, we only discuss the immediate symptoms rather than the general political background to these conflicts.
That is true of the Kurdish problem, it is equally true of the problems in Kosovo or the trouble spots in the CIS states.
Of course we must call emphatically on Turkey to observe the European Convention on Human Rights.
Similarly, we must condemn the death penalty worldwide.
But over and above day-to-day politics, we should use the Öcalan case as an opportunity to take long-term measures, to develop an active European peace policy; but that also means imposing the appropriate sanctions on countries that systematically violate human rights.
Human rights and the right of the people to self-determination must take precedence over economic interests.
Unfortunately, at present the reverse is true.
Every time we stand by and watch basic injustices continue for years without raising our voice, we ourselves become accomplices.
