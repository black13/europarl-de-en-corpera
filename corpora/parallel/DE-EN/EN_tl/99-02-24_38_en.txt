Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament too must take a definite position on the arrest of PKK leader Öcalan.
I find that the opinion delivered by the Committee on External Economic Affairs, Security and Defence Policy of 17 February does not do so, for in my view there is no doubt that the European Parliament must condemn the PKK's terrorism most emphatically.
We must also very strongly condemn the acts of violence committed by PKK fighters throughout Europe.
So we call on all the states to take consistent action to combat this use of force and terrorism, as they keep declaring they will do.
Some EU Member States have not covered themselves in glory in recent years when it came to Öcalan and the PKK.
Let me tell the state minister, Mr Volmer, that these states include Germany, not just Greece.
I can only repeat what we said at our delegation meeting in Istanbul, as President Dankert noted: for Turkey, this arrest is a total success, given the attitude of the European states.
The result is clear to see: acts of violence throughout Europe.
We must be clear about a number of things.
One: Mr Öcalan deserves a fair trial, has a right to a fair trial.
Two: Turkey must also guarantee an independent judiciary.
Three: independent observers must be admitted.
Four: if Mr Öcalan is, as expected, condemned to death, Turkey must allow him to live.
Five: although we totally condemn the PKK's acts of terrorism, Turkey itself must take steps to find political solutions to the Kurdish problems.
Six: Turkey would be sending out a clear signal if it allowed the Kurdish party - which obtained 4.6 % of votes last time - to participate in the elections on 18 April.
That is another demand that is not set out in the statement!
