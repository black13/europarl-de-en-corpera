Mr President, let me give you warm thanks on behalf of my delegation and also of the delegation of Austrian Social Democrats for your words of sympathy on the avalanche disaster in Tyrol.
Let me also make a point of order.
As you said, this was the worst avalanche disaster in Austria since the second world war, although of course other Alpine regions have also been hit, in Italy and France and in a non-Member State, Switzerland.
In Austria, the National Assembly observed one minute's silence for the victims.
I think it would be fitting for the European Parliament also to observe one minute's silence in memory of the victims of the Galt√ºr avalanche.
I would add the further request - addressed to the Commission representatives - for funds to be allocated from the 1999 budget, from budget line B4-330 for protection against environmental and other disasters, to help the regions concerned.
Aid that is given rapidly is doubly useful.
Thank you.
