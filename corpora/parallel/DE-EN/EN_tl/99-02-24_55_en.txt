Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, first I would like to welcome you to your first part-session here.
I can assure you that this new presidency of the Council already enjoys a good advance reputation and we hope that good reputation will be reflected in an equally good outcome to the negotiations with South Africa.
We are surprised that at its last meeting the Council did not accept the compromise Mr Pinheiro negotiated with South Africa.
Four years of negotiations means of course four years of toil on both sides.
We expected a great deal of South Africa after the bitter times of apartheid, a policy that was supported by many EU countries and not just financially.
I think it is, therefore, only appropriate that the European Union should support South Africa, and time is pressing.
Mr Mandela has tried his best.
He needs the support of this agreement for the forthcoming elections - for it is not just European elections that are about to be held, but South African elections too - and support not just from the Member States but from the presidency of the Council.
We do not want the debts of apartheid to have to be paid, because that the would mean that the population, the people of South Africa, would have to pay twice over.
That is one point.
But we also want to try to accommodate them, not just in regard to the wine and sherry market but also in an area that seems to be causing difficulties - for Germany, the Netherlands and Austria - namely the emigration clause.
I believe it is up to us to show that we can reach a rapid outcome by March, and that is what we request and urge you to do as President-in-Office of the Council.
