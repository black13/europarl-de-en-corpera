Madam President, I am not particularly pleased about the reason for this debate, but I am pleased that in this case we have to settle two fundamental questions in a short space of time.
Mr Volmer said in his charming fashion: we are firmly resolved, we are confident, we will do our utmost.
In the same breath he added: but we do not yet know what the various components of the solution will look like.
Thirdly, he said: South Africa has rejected any amendment of the agreement out of hand.
Somewhere in the middle of all this is the discretion that we actually have at our disposal.
Like all the previous speakers on this subject, I personally regard what we are doing with South Africa as a scandal.
Anyone who looks at developments in South Africa can see that things are going downhill, that social conditions are getting worse and worse, that social conflict can be expected when Mbeki takes over from Mandela, because the people who were promised the moon can be given nothing.
We had all hoped this southern African country could hold the promise of economic growth, from which we could draw some hope again for this supposedly lost continent.
And what does the Council do, and incidentally not just after this rejection?
The whole business has been dragging on since 1995, with one scandalous decision after another!
The Council is deliberately allowing a country that needs our help to go downhill.
That has psychological consequences too!
It is a question of credibility, of honesty, which is why you, esteemed representative of the Council, must be as tough and rigorous as you can!
Germany also hesitated for a long time before openly discussing the agricultural problems, but now, like other countries, it is doing so.
I beg you not to underestimate the implications this also has for the European Union!
