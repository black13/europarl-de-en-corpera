Mr President, did I really understand you to say that the Belgian state informed you, the President of the European Parliament, that it could not guarantee the security of sittings in this Chamber?
Secondly, where does it say in the Rules of Procedure that with the agreement of the President the Secretary-General can cancel duly convened parliamentary sittings or other meetings?
Is that not a matter for the Bureau or the responsible bodies?
Applause
Thirdly, do you really think it fitting for the European Parliament to abandon its sittings under pressure of an announced demonstration and to bring its political activities to a halt?
Would it not have been more appropriate for Parliament as such to have spoken to the demonstrators, rather than simply closing its gates?
Applause
