Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I shall be brief.
My group is also in favour of extending the Youth for Europe programme to Turkey, although this decision has nothing to do with our everyday political relations with Turkey or with our serious reservations about certain domestic conditions in Turkey.
Why?
The Youth for Europe programme pursues its own educational objective, which is to promote tolerance among young people towards other ways of thought and life in other countries, through projects of intercultural encounters and exercises in solidarity based on practical participation in local schemes, to name one example.
The programme is aimed at encouraging personal experience and making young people less vulnerable to nationalist movements.
The young Turks who visit my country, even if some of them are hand-picked, do have their first chance to really get to know Europe and to correct the biased picture of Europe they may have received from their national press.
The softening of set ways of thought and the advent of a new generation can bring about socio-political change in a country.
That is precisely why we must support the dialogue with young people in Turkey, with the help also of this democracy programme.
To all those who are against it I would say: the young Turks we invite to our countries should not be made to pay for the wrongs of their government.
We cannot combat nationalist attitudes while at the same time saying no to a cross-frontier dialogue with young people in Turkey.
