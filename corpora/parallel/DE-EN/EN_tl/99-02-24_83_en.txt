Madam President, I think that human rights can only be assured in a country if there are enough people there who stand up for them.
And that is precisely the point of today's debate.
We unreservedly support Turkey's participation in the Socrates and Youth for Europe programmes because we believe that we can make an important contribution by giving young people in Turkey a chance to use the opportunity offered by our programmes to turn their country, Turkey, which, sadly, is rightly described as not sufficiently democratic at this moment, into a democratic republic.
In that sense we regard Mrs Heinisch's report as very useful.
We certainly endorse it and believe that this report, today's discussion and, I hope, the vote in favour will act as a signal in Turkey.
