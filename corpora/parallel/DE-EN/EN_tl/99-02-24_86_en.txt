Madam President, this whole debate in fact shows up the dilemma of human rights discussions in the European Parliament.
We support this report, perhaps also because we believe that there should be no abstentions when it comes to human rights questions.
We must decide for or against, support or impede the process.
We think Turkey must be included in the educational programmes because the level of education of a society always has a direct bearing on the progress of democracy.
We can and must certainly use every political means of persuading Turkey to become more democratic.
But we must not punish the young people for the sins of their political leaders.
These leaders will not change their behaviour if we exclude young people from the educational and cultural programmes.
Perhaps it is a sign of political intelligence if for once we show the ability to differentiate.
