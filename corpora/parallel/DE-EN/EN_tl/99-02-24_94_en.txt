Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me thank Mrs Pack very warmly for her strong support for the Socrates programme.
In particular, I am in favour of a financial boost for this programme.
As rapporteur for the report on the European year of life-long learning, I know how important the Grundtvig III action is, which supports life-long learning for young people without adequate basic training and also for adults who want and need to widen their knowledge and abilities.
If we want to work together in partnership on education and training at European level, we must keep all the parties concerned informed about education and training issues.
In terms of schools, that means we must first of all inform parents and teachers, so that they can recognise and promote the European dimension of education and training jointly with the young people involved.
Especially in the Central and Eastern European countries, in Cyprus and in the Baltic states, parents and others involved in education and training expect to be given the means to support the process of democratisation in schools and in society.
I spoke earlier about the report on Turkish participation in the Socrates and Youth for Europe programmes and I discussed this question with young people and teachers in Istanbul last week, as I did this week in the delegation with our Lithuanian counterparts.
They all regard adult education as a big chance of moving towards a more democratic society in their country.
Here again the old saying I learned at school about adult education still applies: it is often more important to educate and train parents and adults than young people.
So I am glad this programme offers support in that area.
