Mr President, I want to address two particular points in connection with this debate on the excellent and important report drafted by Mrs Pack.
We are talking about the cultural project of promoting cross-frontier language learning.
Here we should take particular note of the situation in the Central and Eastern European countries.
When we visit these countries we keep finding that their inhabitants have an excellent knowledge of our languages, but who of us in western Europe speaks their languages?
It is here that the European Union has a special responsibility to make sure that our young people learn the languages of their Central and Eastern European neighbours, for economic but even more for cultural reasons, for reasons of European policy.
That is my first point.
My second point is one that Mrs Pack has also addressed, namely our special responsibility for frontier areas.
We are now seeing a phenomenon, especially in Austrian frontier areas, where after complaining for years about dead frontiers and deaths and the iron curtain we are suddenly afraid of open frontiers again.
We must respond to this with cultural initiatives, with education and training measures.
So it is most important that we institutionalise this.
Exchanges between pupils, between teachers, but in particular bilingual, even trilingual schools can be a means of linking up these frontier areas not just economically but also in cultural, linguistic terms.
We have the experience of a particular situation in Austria, in KÃ¤rnten, where we have very special Slovenian and German-language educational facilities because of the Slovenian minority.
With the opening up of frontiers, we can now see how useful these young people with their training are in terms of general and cross-frontier economic development.
So we have these examples, which is why I believe that money invested in this programme is money very well spent and well invested.
