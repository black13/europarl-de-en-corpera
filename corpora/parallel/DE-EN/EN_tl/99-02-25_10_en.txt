Mr President, I basically agree with Mr Donnelly's excellent report, though his comments about SMEs in recital D need to be modified a little.
It is certainly not true that smaller firms lack specialist technical knowledge; on the contrary, SMEs are the ones that generate innovation and research in many fields.
Their structure and specialist technical knowledge mean that they are able to react quickly to any software problems that come up.
On the other hand, however, if major firms or public administrations have computer problems, these could have a massive impact on SMEs.
The rapporteur's comments on the nuclear sector in Eastern Europe and Russia are extremely important.
This is a field that is receiving huge financial support from the European Union, but up to now, unfortunately, we have not seen any significant improvement in the safety of nuclear power plants.
It is now high time to make sure that the funding available really is used to improve reactor safety.
It is probably unrealistic to hope that the nuclear power stations will be shut down by the year 2000, so we must at least ensure that there are no breakdowns caused by the year 2000 problem.
We need to give top priority to eliminating any risk to the population of Europe, since Europe's taxpayers have after all provided a lot of money for nuclear safety in Eastern Europe and Russia.
