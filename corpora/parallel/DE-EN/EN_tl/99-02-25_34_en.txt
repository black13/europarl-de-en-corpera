Mr President, I have been trying to get the floor yesterday and this morning, so thank you for giving me the opportunity to say something now.
Yesterday Mrs Stenzel talked about the avalanche disaster in the Tyrol, and I would like to thank her for her words, which we wholeheartedly endorse.
Unfortunately, she specifically said that she was speaking on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists and her own delegation, thus leaving out a third of the Austrian Members.
This was a pity, because in view of the terrible scale of the disaster, we would have been happy for her to speak on our behalf too.
This is no time for internal political grudges.
On behalf of the non-attached Members, therefore, I should also like to convey my deepest sympathies to the families of the victims.
