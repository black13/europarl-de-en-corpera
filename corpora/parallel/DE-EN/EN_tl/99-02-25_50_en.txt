Mr President, I should like to explain why I voted the way I did, because I have been accused of voting in favour of wine and ignoring the beer produced in my constituency.
I deliberately voted in favour of wine, because I happen to believe that wine is one of the most fundamental elements of our civilisation.
We can trace it back to the time of Christ, who performed his first miracle when he turned water into wine.
If he was alive today he might have turned wine into water instead, but he turned water into wine.
This is why we must support wine as part of our European tradition, not to mention the fact that European wine is facing a major onslaught, so we need to increase our defences.
