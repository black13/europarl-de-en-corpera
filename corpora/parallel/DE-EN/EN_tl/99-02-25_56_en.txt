Mr President, I deliberately voted against everything in this resolution because I disagreed with it for the simple reason that it elevates and honours a terrorist who has thousands of victims on his conscience, yet at the same time the President of the European Parliament - not you, but someone else - refused to allow us to discuss the issue of the Albanians in Kosovo, thousands of whom have been murdered by the Serbs, and postponed the debate indefinitely.
I think this is absolutely outrageous, because our first duty is not to terrorists but to innocent civilians, women, children and old people who are being murdered!
That was why I deliberately voted against the entire resolution, because it was extremely inappropriate.
It is not our job to stand up for terrorists, but for those who are working actively and peacefully to secure freedom for their people.
Draft agreement with South Africa (B4-0222/99)
