Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the present report on implementing the principle of equal treatment for men and women provides a good opportunity for asking some crucial questions about women's policy.
We have two rulings by the European Court of Justice before us, in addition to the proposal to amend the Council's directive.
The Committee on Women's Rights finds that the proposed amendment would water down the directive.
Just as it cannot be right to rectify one injustice by committing another, so it cannot be right to rectify the discrimination against women by discriminating against men.
The very concept of positive discrimination should make us think again.
Positive and discrimination: how can you combine the two?
For the word positive must mean removing practical occupational hindrances, obstacles or disadvantages affecting women, such as the shortage of child care facilities or the non-payment of pensions for the years spent in child care.
The strategy of women's policy should not simply be to achieve a numerically fair distribution.
Reverse discrimination in the form of a mechanical preference in fact conflicts with another basic value, namely the equal treatment of every individual.
