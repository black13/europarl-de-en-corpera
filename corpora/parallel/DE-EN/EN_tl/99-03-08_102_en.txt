Mr President, as far as women's rights are concerned, we obviously keep taking one step forward and two steps back.
In regard to equal opportunities for women the Amsterdam Treaty may be one step forward, but the European Court of Justice ruling in the Kalanke case and the Commission proposal to amend Directive 76/207/EEC represent two steps back.
Women today are better educated and more mobile than ever and the number of women in employment is rising.
But there is a definite shortage of women in the higher echelons of politics, industry and science.
That is not because women are less qualified or less intelligent but because of the glass ceiling, an unseen barrier set up consciously or unconsciously by a traditionally male-dominated ruling class.
So why the Commission has replaced the term 'women's opportunities' with the term 'under-represented sex' is beyond me.
We should not adopt a directive that falls short of the Amsterdam Treaty and thereby undermines women's opportunities to occupy a position in society consistent with their qualifications, especially now that the European Parliament and the Vienna Council have taken up the equal opportunities cause.
The Amsterdam Treaty represents progress along the road to equal opportunities.
It must be implemented and not watered down.
So the Lulling report and the request to the Commission to withdraw its amended proposal for a directive make sense.
