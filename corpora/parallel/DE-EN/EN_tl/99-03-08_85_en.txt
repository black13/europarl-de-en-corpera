Madam President, equal rights and equal opportunities for men and women are recognised as an indisputable basic principle of democracy and human rights.
This recognition is reflected in the Amsterdam Treaty, in which equality between men and women is set out as a goal of the Union, and in the fact that the principle of equal opportunities is enshrined as the fourth pillar of EU employment policy.
But the Commission's first progress report shows up the very wide gulf between demands and reality.
For instance it states that the measures taken to date have had no tangible influence on the various policies.
That should give us food for thought.
Of particular importance is the awareness raising, awareness changing and sensitisation of all the various decision-makers in all the various areas of society.
But specifically as a woman I would not want to see the baby thrown out with the bathwater.
Will a call such as that for a balanced participation of women and men in the decision-making process really achieve any added value for women?
Are we talking about quantitative or qualitative equal treatment?
If I manage to succeed in my job, it is not because I am a woman but because of the good work I have done.
I know that many women agree with the view I take of the policy of positive discrimination.
