Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report before us concerns limiting the exposure of the general public to electromagnetic fields 0 Hz - 300 GHz, which is the entire spectrum of possible effects.
This is no doubt a good approach, but it does not allow for detailed rules at European level so that in my view the subsidiarity principle should be applied in some areas.
Overall, it is to be welcomed that the Committee on the Environment did not accept the doubtless well-intentioned proposals from the rapporteur, on the grounds I referred to above.
But well-intentioned does not always mean good.
Moreover, the rapporteur's proposals could not be justified scientifically - as many speakers have mentioned today - and would in practice have led to low limits that could not have been adhered to.
Or should we go so far as to get rid of mobile phones and emergency telephones?
I do not think that can do us much good.
Let me raise another point.
The discussion between experts has shown that laying down safety distances from fixed installations, for example high-voltage transmission lines, is of extremely questionable use in protecting against radiation because, apart from the distance as such, numerous parameters specific to the installation can have quite a determining effect on exposure.
In the case of electrical devices, laying down minimum safety distances is even more of a problem.
As a rule the distance between such devices and the public is surely determined by whether they are used as they should be.
In this case I think it is confusing, unhelpful and inconsistent with the aims of adequate protection against radiation to lay down additional safety distances.
The situation is different in the case of equipment that is designed to produce fields, such as broadcasting transmitters.
Here, safety distances can no doubt simplify matters.
I would ask you to consider this at the vote.
I have tabled the corresponding amendments.
