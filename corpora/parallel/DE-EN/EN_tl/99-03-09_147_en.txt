Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with what Mrs Mann said on behalf of the Socialist Group.
The European People's Party also finds that the USA has quite clearly breached the WTO rules.
But that does not necessarily mean we know what will happen next.
We are familiar with the Americans' political rules of play; the US Administration feels under pressure from Congress, and rather like the case of the Helms-Burton Act, it no longer pays any heed to the rules of international law but seeks instead ways of defending itself from within, which is presumably how we should regard the imposition of unilateral sanctions.
Let me point out quite firmly that we would be well-advised - even if we are in the right with the second part - not to forget that the panel, that the WTO, will probably only find conditionally in our favour on the main issue.
That happens to be the way things go in international law, which is why I would advise the Commission, on behalf of the European People's Party, to do all it can to explore further in the discussions - which Sir Leon described as informal - with the US Administration where there are possibilities of resolving the conflict, rather than leaving it to the final WTO decision, if only because we will be facing an incredible number of points of conflict with the USA in the coming years.
If we believe we have to win this time, we will be the losers in other cases where there might be a willingness to compromise.
That is why we, who all supported and wanted the WTO, urge that it not be regarded merely as a pawn in the conflict of interests between the USA and Europe.
