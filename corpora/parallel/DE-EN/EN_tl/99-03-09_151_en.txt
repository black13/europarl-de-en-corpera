Mr President, it is with bananas of all things that the USA is currently making huge efforts to dismantle the WTO.
Just because Bill Clinton promised the US Congress in autumn 1998 to impose punitive tariffs on 3 March, the WTO rules were bent and broken.
But in fact this will go on happening even after the banana dispute: in May there will the ban on meat with hormones, next will come genetically modified food.
The USA announced and began this massive campaign for free trade a long time ago, without regard for human health or the environment.
But just to appeal to one's adversary to be reasonable really is not enough.
What we must remember is that the USA is overruling the legislation in force.
We must not go on negotiating considerately with opponents of this kind because, Sir Leon, that is precisely the way to further undermine the credibility of the WTO.
The dispute must be settled by the WTO and until that happens all other negotiations with the USA should be suspended.
Here I am thinking in particular of the TEP and the preparations for the millennium round.
I am definitely not a protectionist, but please consider what decisive steps you can take to protect undertakings in the European Union, for things really cannot go on as they are.
If we do not achieve our objective of resolving this dispute, then I fear the WTO will slip on a banana skin.
