Mr President, I wish to speak against the motion, since in my view the argument put forward by Mr Fabre-Aubrespy, namely that cofinancing is impossible because the expenditure is compulsory, is not covered by the EC Treaty.
The question of compulsory expenditure has nothing to do with the way decisions are legitimised, which is why I would ask for the motion to be rejected and the Haug report to be debated now.
