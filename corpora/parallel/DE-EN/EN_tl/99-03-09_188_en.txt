Mr President, the fate of the Haug report on Thursday still rests in the lap of the gods, but nevertheless, many thanks for this great endeavour.
I would like to make it clear that the question of cofinancing agricultural policy has nothing to do with the cheapest version of the net-contributor debate that we keep hearing but that it is necessary in order to achieve what we have always called for: structural reform that will bring about more democracy in expenditure policy and that, above all, can make us capable of enlargement, for otherwise we would never manage to finance eastward enlargement.
In my view, to describe this is as 'the only communitised policy' is just a clich√© to hide the fact that in this area, which accounts for nearly half the budget, there is no democratic control.
When the ministers for agriculture meet and decide on their EUR 45 billion, neither the European Parliament nor any regional or national parliament has any say.
That is the fundamental mistake in what is called the communitised agricultural policy.
Support for environmental policy in rural areas, yes, as a structural policy, but support for a single sector, the agricultural sector, really is out of date in my view.
It casts very serious doubt on the credibility of European policy-making and is something that must also be discussed during the negotiations on a new financial framework.
In that respect I warmly thank the Committee on Budgets for nailing its colours to the mast!
