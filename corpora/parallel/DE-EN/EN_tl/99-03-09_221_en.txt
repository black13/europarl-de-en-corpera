Mr President, following the Commissioner's answer I would like to put a general question to the Commission.
Is it really in the EU's interest that we thereby also put many of our trading partners in a very difficult position?
Is it really in our interest that we thereby cause market disturbances, whereas in my view it would be far more important to have strong partners and fair competition?
