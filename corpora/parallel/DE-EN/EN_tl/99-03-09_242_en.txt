Mr President, Commissioner, I was in America again recently and one thing was crystal clear to me: drugs cannot just be combated at the frontiers, by checking consignments from the producer countries to the consumer countries; it is far more effective to shape the legal system in the consumer countries in such a way as to make drugs traffic more difficult, as is done in the United States for instance.
What does the Commission propose to do to combat drugs here in Europe?
