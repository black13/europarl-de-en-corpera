Mr President, my supplementary concerns the punitive tariffs themselves that the United States has imposed unilaterally.
According to our view of the law these measures are direct trade restrictions that even now, at this cautionary stage, are inflicting serious damage on our domestic firms.
How will you bring claims for compensation in the event that the WTO panel declares these measures inadmissible on principle or in terms of their level?
