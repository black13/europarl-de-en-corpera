Mr President, this report is an admirable and very well formulated attempt to chart a course between various conflicting mega-interests, what a skier would call a slalom.
But it has no clear thrust.
In order to develop that, the report should really be referred back to committee.
During the debate emphasis has repeatedly been put on the need for economic and social cohesion and solidarity, and rightly so.
But solidarity also means that all the Member States must commit themselves fully to combating waste, corruption and mismanagement.
For when it comes to collecting revenue we see particularly large losses in the Member States as a result of irregularities and fraud.
The aim of the future own resources system must not just be to make the revenue system more transparent, simpler and more rational but also to reduce the burden on European taxpayers as a whole.
In this context, any European Central Bank profits should not, as proposed, be paid into the Community budget but accrue to the Member States' budgets.
