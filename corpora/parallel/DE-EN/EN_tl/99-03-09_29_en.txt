Madam President, while thanking the rapporteurs I also have one point of criticism.
The committee proposes that the vote on approval of the President of the Commission and the Commission as a whole shall be taken by roll call.
That is a grave mistake.
Behind rules there are thoughts, ideas, concepts, aims, strategies.
What were the Heads of State and Government thinking when they wrote into the Treaties that the vote on a motion of censure shall be by roll call?
The thought behind that is obvious.
Roll-call votes split Parliament into national delegations and political groups.
This puts Parliament under pressure and therefore makes it subject to control.
That is the point of a roll-call vote.
Now we are introducing it for approval of the President of the Commission and the Commission as a whole.
And that means that we too are exposing ourselves to pressure and can therefore be controlled.
That is the result!
Parliament would be stronger if the vote were by secret ballot.
In fact the Commission would also be stronger if the vote were by secret ballot.
This vote on approval would not give the impression of being a forced vote.
That is why I regard this as a grave mistake.
I cannot imagine that Members really want it.
Hence my appeal to support the amendments calling for a vote by secret ballot.
