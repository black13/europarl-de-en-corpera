Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first I want to thank the two rapporteurs, Mr Sarlis and Mr Swoboda, for their cooperation in committee.
There is no doubt that these are two very important reports.
The whole package of measures is crucial to the further development of European policy on rail transport; or I could say, looking at the station clock, that we had better run for the train so as not to miss it, that it is high time Parliament and the Council finally tackled this subject.
So I welcome the proposals on gradual liberalisation and boosting competitiveness.
Another important aspect is the separation between railway undertakings, the separation between transport infrastructure management and transport services, between use and maintenance.
This separation is vital to prevent distortion of competition and discrimination.
Let me also point to the importance of the railways in relation to combined transport.
The railways are a more environmentally friendly, safe and expandable mode of transport and must therefore continue to be supported in future.
As we all know, the capacity of the railways is still far from exhausted, in relation to the transport of both goods and passengers.
It is vital for the railways to become competitive and become a serious alternative to road transport.
The EU and the Member States must remedy any shortcomings in this respect if they genuinely are to put forward a credible policy in support of an environmentally friendly transport mode.
That also means allocating the necessary budget funds.
Shifting transport from road to rail will help preserve the environment throughout Europe.
It is also important to promote rail transport with a view to the new Member States we will no doubt be welcoming among us one day.
