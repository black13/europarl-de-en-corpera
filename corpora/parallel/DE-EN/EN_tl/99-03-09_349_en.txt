Mr President, we support the proposed compromise in order to optimise the way the European capital of culture is selected.
But perhaps it is not so very important which city is finally chosen.
Perhaps it is especially important, however, to define in precise terms the responsibility that city will have to assume.
What is important here is the content of the submission, as listed in Article 2a for instance, including the need to promote dialogue between European cultures and those from other parts of the world.
There is one thing we must not forget: in a future united Europe the cultural capital of Europe will not just represent itself but will act as Europe's cultural ambassador for that period.
