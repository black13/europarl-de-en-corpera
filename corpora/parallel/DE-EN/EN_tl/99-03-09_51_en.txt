Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is a German proverb that fits the bill in the EU as regards orphan drugs.
It goes as follows: if you go on long enough, it will be alright in the end.
It took the Commission long enough to present a proposal for a European orphan drug act.
What I expect of this regulation is that it will provide a strong incentive for the development of these medicines and therefore for research into molecular biology.
Unfortunately, the Commission felt it was unable to follow the US model in regard to providing additional tax relief, tax relief at least in the sense of definite recommendations for action on the part of the Member States.
I would certainly be interested to know whether the Commission sees any possibility of doing so.
But experiences in the USA show that tax advantages offer the most effective stimulus for investment in orphan drug development.
In general terms, the reasons for EU-wide tax harmonisation are accumulating by the day and the orphan drug regulation is another reason.
It would also be a good idea to set up a special fund for additional support for the development of these medicines.
There are no bounds to what we could imagine here, even if a certain amount of state dirigisme is required to achieve our aims.
