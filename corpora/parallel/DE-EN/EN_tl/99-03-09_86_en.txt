Madam President, I voted against the Hautala report, or rather against all the amendments except those tabled by the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations, out of inner conviction.
As Christians we cannot pronounce against life and the unborn child is just as alive as the child that has been born.
This is something we find quite simply intolerable, which is why I voted against out of my innermost conviction.
Today we are in the minority.
Perhaps we will be in the majority one day, for in the long term this situation will be a great disaster for our population.
Let me also say that I am not against women, for whom I have infinite respect.
I have seven children and 18 grandchildren.
So you can imagine how much I respect my wife.
All I want to say here is that this is precisely why I voted against the Hautala report.
