Madam President, I greatly regret that the Hautala report was debated yesterday, on International Women's Day, because I do not believe it really contributes to the dignity and honour of women; it is in fact a disgrace.
It is surely rather curious for a report on women's health to call for the alleged right to abortion.
For me, health policy means saving lives and not destroying them.
If a report on women's health does refer to abortion in the first place, then in my view there should also be some discussion of the effects of post-abortion syndrome.
But the harmful psychological effects that abortions have on women are deliberately and constantly concealed.
Pregnancy is not an illness!
It is absurd to posit a so-called women's right to go against the right to life, which applies to everyone.
Demands of this kind abuse the dignity of women and create a culture of death, which in the final analysis rebounds against women and harms them.
For these reasons I had to vote against the Hautala report.
