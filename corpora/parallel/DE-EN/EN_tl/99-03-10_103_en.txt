Mr President, the Amsterdam Treaty sets new standards for health policy in Europe.
The Commission has provided us with information on this.
Some aspects of the approach adopted in the Needle report are good, but in other places it oversteps the mark.
The fact that there are unsuccessful health policies in some Member States is no reason for shifting the responsibility to European level.
That is why I have voted against the Needle report.
We must use the little money we have in Europe for specific projects, and not distribute it here, there and everywhere.
