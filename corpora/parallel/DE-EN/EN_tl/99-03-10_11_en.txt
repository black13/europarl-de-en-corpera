Mr President, when I gave my reasons for making my request, I only referred to UCLAF because of the row over handing over the report on the ECHO affair.
I understand that these rules are not about UCLAF.
On behalf of my group, I should like to support what Mrs Green has said.
I believe that we should give the House the opportunity to read this carefully and in full, because we are formulating certain rights and conventions here which affect a fundamental right contained within Article 206.
It should be examined with the utmost care.
This week is very busy, so I suggest we postpone the issue to the next part-session, and then we can take our time over our decision.
