Mr President, with this report and its one-sided view of the Middle East peace process the European Parliament is continuing a rather sad tradition.
While repeatedly denouncing supposed human rights violations in Israel, Parliament is treating human rights violations on the part of Arab dictatorships and the Palestinian administration with much greater caution.
We consider direct interference in the election to be unacceptable.
Israel is the only democracy in the region and the political strategy of the democratically-elected government should be respected.
After all, the peace process did not reach a state of deadlock because the wrong politicians are in power in Israel but because Arab terrorists refuse to end their campaign.
Critics of Israel have not yet learned very much when it comes to supporting Israel in the fight against terrorism, which costs the lives of hundreds of innocent people every year.
Finally, I would like to comment on a point made by one of the previous speakers, who described the Gaza Strip as a concentration camp.
This comparison with the Nationalist Socialist death camps is absolutely outrageous.
