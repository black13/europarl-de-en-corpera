Mr President, Commissioner, I welcome the fact that these two reports are being discussed jointly here as the problems experienced in this region can only be solved by a joint effort on the part of all concerned.
However, when it comes to the Middle East peace process, we are repeatedly given the impression that Israel is considered to be largely responsible.
I also notice that these reports are tolerant towards shortcomings on the part of the Palestinians, but where similar shortcomings are detected on the other side they are accompanied by warnings or criticisms.
Some of the wording is also reminiscent of the resolutions on countries in Africa which waver between military dictatorships and one-party regimes and regularly have to be warned to observe the principles of democracy.
But Israel is more or less the only functioning democracy in the whole region and it is also a country that is particularly under threat.
When Members of this House always demand that the same concessions should be shown to the parties to the conflict, we wonder why the same tolerance is not shown towards Israel.
Why is Israel required to accept a separate Palestinian state instead of also expecting the Palestinians to appreciate that Israel is currently in a special situation and that allowance must be made for its sensitivity, especially after the repeated terrorist attacks?
Now, more than ever, patience is required, as it always is when a country is about to hold important elections.
This patience will certainly also be required when the deadline of 4 May, agreed in Oslo, expires.
We cannot then allow one side to create a fait accompli.
In my view it would not hurt us to be more pro-Israel in our advice.
It deserves it.
