Mr President, on the subject of using nuclear energy to produce electricity, in recent years we have had two camps: the enthusiastic supporters and the resolute opponents.
Since the German Government's unambiguous rejection of nuclear power and the announcements by Belgium and Switzerland in recent weeks that they too will not use this technology, we are now faced with a completely new situation.
This technology no longer has a future.
In view of the fact that there is also enormous doubt concerning the economic viability of nuclear power stations, as established in the last few days by the Pemelin commission, Euratom loans for the construction of new reactors can no longer be justified.
For our own safety we must devote all our efforts to setting new parameters in energy supply.
Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz recognised this clearly.
Her amendments are a step in the right direction.
