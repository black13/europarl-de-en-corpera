Mr President, would you please be so good as to ask the Commission to be present this evening for the debate on this very important topic?
The Commission talked longer this afternoon than all the Members put together, and as a result it is not possible for us to continue the debate now.
I would ask you to urge the Commission to ensure that it is present this evening so that we can continue.
