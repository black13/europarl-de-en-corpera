Mr President, I should just like to seek clarification on the timetable.
Obviously I accept that we will not be voting on the agreement on information today.
I would simply like to know whether it will therefore be put on the agenda of the mini-session.
I have to know so that I can plan a further discussion of it.
I think that the same goes for the Committee on Institutional Affairs; it might also need to discuss it again, since it is of course the committee responsible.
It is, after all, the one which has tabled this report here, not the Committee on Budgetary Control.
In any case, we want to discuss it again and I just need to know whether it will be on the agenda then.
