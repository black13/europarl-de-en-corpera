Mr President, it is quite obvious that there is a strong, powerful lobby on the side of those who are against abolishing duty-free, while there is no-one on the other side because it is made up of small groups and small businesses.
I wonder whether account will be taken of the consequences that will arise if duty-free is allowed to continue.
Will that not destroy many more jobs in small businesses that are not in the right place and do not have the opportunities available to all the other large firms?
