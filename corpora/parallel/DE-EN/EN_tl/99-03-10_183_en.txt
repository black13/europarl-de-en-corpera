Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, I will try not to ask a hypothetical question.
Instead, I wish to ask about your personal views.
You cited the paragraphs that need to be changed.
Now I would ask you whether you really see the need for the Treaties to be amended in this way in view of recent events.
