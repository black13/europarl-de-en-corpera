Madam President, have I understood correctly?
Is the Commissioner refusing to accept Amendments Nos 6 and 11?
If that is so, we might just as well go home now.
If we just have your ECU 68 million over five years and no legislative measures - because you do not seem to want to take those on board - we will not get anywhere at all.
That is quite obvious!
So when are you finally going to present some legislative measures, because without them this charade will go on forever.
