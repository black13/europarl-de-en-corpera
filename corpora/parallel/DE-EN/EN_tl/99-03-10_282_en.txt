Madam President, I am delighted that you have called upon me to speak on behalf of the non-attached Members, but as there is no such group, I have the luxury of speaking on my own behalf, as anything else would not be logical.
I have started off very dangerously, as with only one minute's speaking time, you can only afford such a long introduction if you can refer to what someone else has already said.
In this case I am pleased to say that I fully agree with all Mrs Randzio-Plath's requests and would simply like to support them, in particular her call for the Commission to launch a real initiative and, as far as possible, to ensure transparency.
However, the vital point is not that the public are now paying excessively high charges, but the fact that this came as a surprise.
They had no idea what they were in for, and that is what is really wrong.
The same members of the public who had to put up with major packages of cuts in order to meet the convergence criteria were persuaded to accept those criteria on the grounds that in future they would be able to travel within Euroland just as they had travelled within their own country in the past.
The fact is, that has not happened.
Charges still exist and in some cases they have even risen.
The public do not perhaps feel that they have been cheated - I do not want to exaggerate - but at the very least they feel let down.
This has done nothing to enhance the European Union's reputation in the eyes of the public in the various Member States.
