Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the Berlin summit must succeed in tying up the Agenda 2000 package.
A delay would send out a fateful signal to the EU and the outside world and would only encourage nationalist forces.
We must not allow this to happen.
If next year we are to continue to provide structural support - the internal bridge between poor and rich regions - then we need an agreement on Agenda 2000 which, in small matters and in large, is characterised by solidarity, will be workable in the future and leaves no room for national egoism.
Outwardly, the failure of the summit would mean the failure of the great pan-European project of eastward enlargement.
That is why there is no room here for exaggerated national demands.
We make this plea to the Council: all the Heads of State and Government must travel to Berlin prepared in all earnest to close the gap between them.
That applies just as much to the German Government as it does to the southern countries.
Because when huge efforts have been required of the applicant countries for years, it would be a fateful sign if the EU were simply not to hand in its homework.
The European Parliament has proved through the compromises in its reports that an agreement is possible, including on the crucial points.
The demands are balanced and they are before the Council.
So it is possible!
