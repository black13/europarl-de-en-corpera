Mr President, I refer to yesterday's Question Time, and in particular page 24 of the Minutes.
At that point, I actually asked Mrs Gradin a question in connection with the false statement which Mrs Cresson made before the Committee on Budgetary Control; I asked her whether Mrs Cresson should resign because of this.
Mrs Gradin did not answer the question.
This course of events is now recorded in the Minutes as follows.
It simply says: 'Mr Posselt spoke'.
I should like to point out, however, that I asked a perfectly proper supplementary to which no answer was given.
Loud applause
