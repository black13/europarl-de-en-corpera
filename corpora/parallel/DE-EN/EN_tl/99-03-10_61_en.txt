Mr President, I should particularly like to say that I fully agree with my friend, Mr Dupuis.
The real problem is Mr Milosevic, just as the problem in Iraq is Saddam Hussein.
To make peace, you need two people: to wage war, one is sufficient.
We should not forget that.
In our view, that means two things: firstly, we need credibility on our side, and we need to demonstrate our credibility when we talk about democracy.
In an international context, democracy is nothing other than peoples' right to self-determination, which is something people love to talk about, but which, once they have won a war, they quickly forget.
This has time and again proved to be a curse for humanity.
Secondly, we should not labour under any illusions, and here I agree with Mr Titley: without a military presence, there will be no peace here.
It is absolutely essential.
It should not be prolonged indefinitely, but it must be there, it must be perceptible, and it must actually ensure that the commitments or promises signed up to are kept.
We certainly do not want to shut out the Serbian people; Serbs are also Europeans and some day they too will have a right to belong to Europe, but that can only be the case under a genuinely civilised regime, and not under a totalitarian dictatorship, which is what Milosevic's system is.
Applause
