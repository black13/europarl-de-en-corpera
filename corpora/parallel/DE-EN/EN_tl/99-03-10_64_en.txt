Mr President, the Rambouillet peace process should be supported for one simple reason.
We have nothing better!
Nevertheless, we are forced to realise that it has not been possible to square the circle.
Milosevic is still refusing to allow a military intervention force in Kosovo, and the KLA is refusing to disarm and be satisfied with autonomy.
The Kosovars' weakness, their political fragmentation, is Milosevic's strength.
You cannot help thinking that both sides have simply used the break in the negotiations to arm themselves for the forthcoming spring offensive.
The flurry of political activity, on the part of both the European presidency and the United States, has done nothing to change this.
Once again, as has been the case so often before in the Balkans, this situation is exposing the weaknesses of the so-called international community.
NATO is, admittedly, still ready to give the order to go into action, but the credibility of the only western military alliance to remain intact has suffered in Kosovo, not only because of the jealousy which keeps on surfacing between the United States and France, but also, and above all, because of the European partners' hesitation to become involved in a cost-intensive military operation which might last for years.
We can only continue to note this lack of political will with regret, and call on the Europeans finally to make up their minds about what we call the common foreign and security policy!
