Mr President, I can oppose this both as rapporteur and on my own account.
I should like to make the following quite clear: firstly, rail freight has been declining for years, as has employment in the sector.
That is why it is absolutely essential and high time to reform the railways.
That is the idea behind my own and Mr Sarlis's reports.
Secondly, it is unfortunate that the Commission rejected some of our points yesterday.
That is why it is also high time to explain our point of view clearly to the Commission.
We are not calling for unlimited, broad-brush liberalisation; we are calling for a sensible approach towards giving the railways more of a European dimension.
We have to achieve this, and that is why I really do ask that we put this to the vote today.
We have discussed it at length in the committee; Mrs Moreau was the only one to vote against.
That is why it is important for us to vote today.
Applause
