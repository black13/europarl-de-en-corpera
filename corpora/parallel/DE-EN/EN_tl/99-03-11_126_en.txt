Madam President, Cuba, as we know, is not the United States.
In contrast to the United States, Cuba has guaranteed schooling and free health care, as well as all the achievements that have freed it from its former dependence on the United States.
So why does the Cuban Government imitate one of the most appallingly undemocratic and totalitarian systems ever invented?
Why on earth do the Cubans not launch a campaign to prove themselves more democratic than the United States by respecting human rights and abolishing the death penalty?
The Cuban Government has done the exact opposite.
It has added to its list of capital offences.
No democrat or Socialist can approve of that, because it is a gross violation of the most fundamental of all human rights, namely the right to life.
Societies are changing everywhere, and Cuba is no exception.
We should make it unmistakably clear to the Cuban Government and the Cuban people that we are prepared to develop our economic, social and cultural relations with Cuba, and that to this end we need to establish contacts with open-minded, creative and democratic Cubans and their organisations, whether within the ACP framework or on the basis of a bilateral agreement.
In order to accomplish this, we seek dialogue.
We hope that the Cuban leadership will be far-sighted enough to pull together with us in this venture.
