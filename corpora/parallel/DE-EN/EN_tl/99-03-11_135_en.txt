Mr President, we are prepared to support the efforts to establish democracy in Indonesia.
I believe the entire House and the other EU institutions are also willing to lend material support to a peaceful democratisation process.
However, Indonesia will also have to show that it wants a peaceful process and that it is actively encouraging democracy, and in this respect there are two regions that we consider to be very important.
The first of these is East Timor.
The referendum in East Timor must be organised as quickly as possible; in actual fact, the independence of East Timor is historically inevitable.
The repression there has to be ended, and Mr Habibie knows that.
I believe we should act quickly to assist in the transition to independence.
Such assistance might, for example, take the form of training for East Timorese administrators in the European Union, in the Member States, with a view to the creation of an administrative infrastructure that would enable East Timor to manage its own affairs.
The second region is the Moluccas, where we must ensure that an end is put to the conflicts which are raging at the present time and which are apparently being encouraged by the police.
On Ambon, we have a situation in which 85 % of the island's population are Christians.
We must prevent the outbreak of hostilities between religious groups, and in this respect a heavy burden of responsibility falls on the government in Jakarta to demilitarise the population by restraining the police and by using the police force to uphold law and order, rather than to fan the flames of conflict.
If that happens, I believe our only option is to call on the Commission to provide humanitarian aid in these conflict-torn areas and to support the campaign for democracy and the elections, and to do these things as quickly as possible in order to ensure that peace prevails throughout Indonesia.
Applause
