Madam President, in his remarkable report, Mr Four√ßans very clearly addresses the major issues of European economic policy.
He advocates a stability-based monetary policy and sound budgetary policy.
For that he has our approval.
We share his concern about the French, German and Italian budget deficits which were forecast for 1995 and which amounted to 2 % of GDP or more.
Given the economic power of those three countries, this could well have had serious consequences for their smaller partners in the event of a crisis.
I support many of the proposals in the report, but time permits me to highlight only three, namely the wish to channel more investments into research, education and training for reasons of competitiveness, the wish to restrict the consumption of non-renewable resources while developing new forms of sustainable technology, and lastly the need to reduce labour costs without endangering the funding of social security systems.
