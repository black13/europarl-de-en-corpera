Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, although the need to coordinate economic policies is emphasised at every available opportunity, practice has shown us that there is still a wide gap between analysing and evaluating the main indicators of the economic situation and initiating the necessary decisions.
An action plan is therefore becoming essential if we are to close that gap.
Even the present report by Mr Fourçans, the general thrust of which I welcome, still lacks the courage to draw the logical conclusions from its proposals and demand more and better coordination of economic and monetary policy.
An economic landscape that is overclouded by investment fatigue will not bring forth the necessary growth or the necessary crop of jobs.
In this context, let me say that fear is the only reason why we are now saving more, and worshipping the golden calf of budgetary consolidation - important though such consolidation may be - is surely a short-sighted and inadequate response.
This has nothing to do with Keynesianism, which is often misunderstood.
As long as we cannot conduct a coordinated economic policy based on sound arguments, a policy in which monetary policy also plays a key role, both inside and outside the European Union, it will prove difficult to promote employment, growth and stability.
A gratifying feature of the Fourçans report is the very responsible way in which it deals with the question of incomes and competition.
I believe this approach will guarantee that the present rather complex economic situation will not be exacerbated by an erosion of purchasing power.
That would stifle any additional growth, which is the last thing we want at this precise time.
Impetus is what we need now, fresh impetus and a bolder approach, for more employment and more growth.
