Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are speaking about an employment pact in the belief that jobs can be safeguarded if the representatives of employers and employees jointly formulate policy objectives.
We have to tread warily here, because it is the consumer alone who creates work and determines employment policy.
Consumers, in other words we, the people, decide what to buy; we choose the manufacturers of the products we want to buy and their regions of origin.
Fortunately, consumers are very objective.
They judge the value of the product on offer.
In that respect they are very critical.
When consumers go into a shop, they do not search the packaging of every product to find out where it was made; they base their choice on price, quality and customer service.
I believe we must focus far more sharply on the need to train our employees and our businesses to recognise the needs of the customer and to anticipate the customer's future needs.
What makes a good company is its dedication to identifying the future wishes of its customers.
To that end, such companies need an efficient government.
We must ensure that statutory charges are reduced, that the machinery of public administration operates more efficiently, that we replace redundant departments, by which I mean that we should restructure unproductive departments into genuine service organisations.
That is also a particularly important task for the European Union.
We must set a good example here.
I believe it is worth fighting hard to achieve that aim.
