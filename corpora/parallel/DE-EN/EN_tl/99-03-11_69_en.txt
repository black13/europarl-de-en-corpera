Madam President, we reject both the principle of cofinancing and the introduction of a degressive approach to subsidies.
We are opposed to the idea of revising the European budget at the expense of our farmers.
Moreover, we are also vehemently opposed to the development of new ways of providing the EU with its own resources, because we do not wish to impose any additional burdens on the people of Europe.
It is also wrong to dispute the connection between the Cohesion Fund and the euro area.
No country that is ready for the euro is in need of these funds.
Solidarity cannot and must not be one-sided.
In general terms, the aim on the revenue side of the EU budget must be to create greater transparency and an equitable distribution of burdens.
Since the House has rejected the principle of cofinancing - a decision which we welcome - and since some parts of the report that reflect our views were adopted, while others were rejected, we abstained in the final vote.
