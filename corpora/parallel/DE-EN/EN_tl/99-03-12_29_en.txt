Mr President, India is a country where nearly everything is on such a large scale as to make it a problematic as well as an important and promising partner for the European Union.
This report clearly addresses the priority areas, the acute problems and those that are more deeply rooted.
A great deal has already been said, and quite rightly, about the nuclear tests, but I nevertheless believe that the development of the partnership has to depend upon the decisions made in this area.
It is also important for India to sign the Ottawa Convention banning anti-personnel mines.
I feel it is particularly important for the EU, both in its overall partnership policy and in its relations with India, to be significantly involved in the fight against the exploitation of children.
The contradictions between legislation in this field and the way it is implemented in India are far too great.
It is also quite staggering that such technologically gifted people - I am thinking here of the software sector, for example - allow their children to be socially and sexually exploited to such a dreadful extent.
Campaigns run by the central government have failed due to the resistance of organised crime and corruption and the lack of flanking measures.
The extreme suffering caused to children forced into prostitution, particularly those from Nepal, is quite simply unacceptable.
I therefore feel that the proposal in paragraph 44, based on an initiative taken by President Clinton, is a constructive approach which may give some practical substance to European concern about the exploitation of children.
Firms would have to agree voluntarily to comply with certain minimum criteria in return for a fixed payment or bonus.
Implementing and policing this would certainly require some degree of political will and administrative expenditure, but it would be a definite signal and would hold out the prospect of achieving progress.
