Mr President, I would like to explain why we abstained in the vote on Mrs André-Léonard's report, which was discussed together with Mr Truscott's report yesterday.
The simple reason is that we have a problem with human rights violations in Uzbekistan, which in our view are not compatible with the clause in the preamble stating that the protection of human rights and democratic principles are prerequisites for the Agreement.
That is why we abstained.
We want a close relationship, but we feel that this P.A. can only become effective if Uzbekistan genuinely succeeds in establishing a stable democracy.
Yesterday the Commission failed to convince us that this could be achieved solely by means of this economic agreement.
It was also at a loss to answer the questions we raised, and as a result we feel that this is not the right time to ratify this Agreement.
A further problem in our eyes, which is still not being taken into account in connection with the important question of whether to recognise Uzbekistan as a safe third country, is that there is no free access to the courts there, hence a basic condition for recognition is lacking.
This is part and parcel of the Agreement, but the basic conditions are not being met.
Therefore we were not able to agree to the ratification procedure at this point.
Truscott report (A4-0069/99)
