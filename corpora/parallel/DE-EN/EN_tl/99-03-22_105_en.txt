Mr President, at this precise moment, when the subject of the Kurds is very much on the agenda throughout Europe, the measures proposed by the rapporteur, Mrs Terrón i Cusí, are urgent necessities.
Her criticism of the action plan is warranted too.
The European Union can use its policy as a means of ensuring that the people of that region are able to focus their lives on their homeland and to live on their native soil where they feel at home.
As long as we in the European Union cannot eliminate the root causes of these refugee movements, as long as there is no peace in the region and as long as the political repression of minorities is common practice, we need an efficiently administered asylum procedure as proposed by the rapporteur.
My group also supports your proposals on dealing with Turkey as the country of initial reception for refugees from Iraq.
It is very important to us that the organisation and implementation of this initial reception in Turkey should be entrusted to the UNHCR alone.
We also subscribe to Mrs Terrón i Cusí's view that the Commission must present a new proposal, on which the opinion of the European Parliament must be heard, before the Council takes its decision.
That would be an exemplary procedure and would befit the serious nature of the matter under discussion.
