Mr President, the question we are discussing today may seem dry and technical, but appearances are deceptive.
This is all about whether the Union can summon up the strength to discuss or regulate properly the conditions of competition in the single market and to eliminate the opportunities for both tax evasion and distortion of competition that exist in the realm of value added tax under the recipient-country principle.
That is indeed a crucial requirement.
I can fully endorse what the previous speakers have said on that point.
This is really the political point of the Secchi report.
I do not think we should labour under the illusion that it will be easy to meet this target of 1 January 2000.
But it is right for us as a Parliament to put this demand on the bargaining table again.
That way, there is a chance that at least the fundamental principle will have been accepted by the target date.
