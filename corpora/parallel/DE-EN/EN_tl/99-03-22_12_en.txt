Mr President, tomorrow's agenda includes the De Giovanni report on scrutiny of the exercise of the Commission's powers.
The Committee on Budgetary Control has asked me to recommend to the House that this report be referred back to the Committee on Institutional Affairs, since the Committee on Budgetary Control urgently needs to discuss this matter further, particularly in the light of what is in the Wise Men's report and in terms of access to information and the supply of information.
I would ask you to take a vote on whether this report can be removed from the agenda and referred back to the Institutional Affairs Committee.
I have already spoken to the chairman, and we agree that the events of the last few days have made some additional work necessary.
