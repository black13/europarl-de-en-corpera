Mr President, may I say to Mr Donnelly that the President-in-Office told us we had made use of our democratic right and had done our duty.
Had the Commission been prepared to give us access to all the relevant information when the scandal first broke, we should not have needed the Committee of Wise Men, and we are every bit as capable as the Wise Men of producing the second report if we obtain the necessary information from the Commission.
Let me address a brief remark to the Commission and its President.
It is not as if the crisis had already begun when the reforms started to bite.
On the contrary, Leonardo did not appear on the scene until 1998, and the problems surrounding Mrs Cresson have only come to our attention in the last few months.
That is why this is so disastrous, as is the fact that all the financial transactions which were undertaken by the Commission and which are now being criticised in the Wise Men's report were given the go-ahead by Financial Control.
Lastly, may I say just a few words on the Wise Men's report and on our activity here in Parliament.
Does it surprise anyone that the Socialist Group gagged those of its members who were against giving a discharge in respect of the 1996 budget?
Does it surprise anyone that the Socialist Group voted against Mr BÃ¶sch, the rapporteur on the Anti-Fraud Office, OLAF, who is one of their own members, and does it surprise anyone that the coordinator of the Socialist Group in the Committee on Budgetary Control resigned her post in protest at the policy of her group leader?
Against this background, it was probably only to be expected that the head of the group would table a motion of censure with the intention of withdrawing it again.
If the Socialist Group had behaved as consistently back in January as they now claim to have done, we might have had a new Commission up and running by now and could have spared ourselves the crisis we have all been discussing today.
