Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we must learn to distinguish between European programmes and their poor management by the Commission.
Mrs Cresson did not have carte blanche to do what she did and say: it is a good programme so I can do what I want.
But conversely, we must not now jeopardise a good programme by postponing it because of poor management.
We should really distinguish between the two, which is why we should vote today.
Applause
(Parliament rejected the request)
(The President declared the common position approved as amended)
