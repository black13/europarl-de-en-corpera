Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this report is extremely important in economic terms.
We have very grave reservations, especially concerning Amendment No 4, which drops the retention provision, and Amendment No 5, which extends the expiry date to 20 years.
I wonder whether we should not reconsider them.
The case of Amendments Nos 1 and 2 is different.
They define the raw materials of agricultural and forestry products.
I know that the Council working group discussed whether a definition should not be set out at least in the recitals.
The line then taken was that a producer who genetically modifies seeds would in any case have to be regarded as the producer of a raw material and it was not considered necessary to clarify this further.
I think that is quite wrong.
I believe it is absolutely essential to endorse these two amendments.
They would ensure that farmers who use genetically modified products can have recourse to the producers of the genetically modified seeds.
That could not be done under the proposal as it stands now.
Farmers, any small farmer, could be held liable for damage caused by genetically modified products - a quite inconceivable and unthinkable situation! - while those responsible for the genetic modifications, large companies like Monsanto and Novartis, would not be in any way liable.
That cannot be in our interest!
So I urge you most sincerely to endorse these two amendments.
