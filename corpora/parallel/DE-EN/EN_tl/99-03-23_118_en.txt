Mr President, I regretfully had to abstain in this vote and I would like to explain why.
Basically I was very much in favour, but there were two points I could not accept.
The first is that this resolution leaves the road open for this so-called Committee of Experts, which has indeed done well here, to go on working for ever.
It is quite simply a mistake on the part of Parliament to bring in outsiders instead of assigning these tasks to the Committee on Budgetary Control.
That is the first reason.
The second is that I find the resolution far too weak.
We could have taken a much more vigorous and definite approach since this was after all an affair in which Parliament has finally shown a bit of muscle, which could have been reflected more strongly in this resolution.
