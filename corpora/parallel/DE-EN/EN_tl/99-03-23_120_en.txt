Mr President, I too voted for the resolution.
Nevertheless, I do not think Parliament has exactly covered itself with glory.
It would have been better had we had the courage in January to call on Parliament to take matters further towards their logical conclusion.
I believe that in future we must not just call for the restructuring of the Commission but also become more self-confident vis-Ã -vis the Commission ourselves.
Let me give an example: in my opinion the way in which the Commission fobs us off with our written questions is quite appalling!
Some of what it puts in its answers is ridiculous and I really wish that the President of the Commission, but also the Bureau of Parliament, would make it clear to the Commission that we expect proper answers and indeed answers which stand up in law against the Commission.
We do not want information we already know!
Secondly, I would really like to see a rigorous investigation into whether there really was any indirect party funding.
I hope these reports will be made public before the European elections so that we can give the taxpayers the opportunity to make it clear who they are choosing.
In short, I believe that Parliament should not just accept the way it is treated by the Commission, which is why I emphatically ask the Bureau to seek to ensure that in future questions to the Commission are answered in more precise and exact terms.
