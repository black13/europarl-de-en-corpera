Mr President, let me too begin by saying that I sometimes find the voting goes too fast.
I did ask for the floor during the vote, but unfortunately the President did not notice.
That is why I want to say right away that I mistakenly voted against Amendment No 19 by the I-EDN Group on the joint resolution on the resignation of the Commission and the appointment of a new Commission, although I had in fact intended to vote for it.
But let me turn now to my oral explanation of vote.
Even at first reading of this report, we voted for the new Leonardo II programme.
We did so because the principle of lifelong learning must of course be supported and must be implemented by means of practical measures.
A particularly positive aspect of this report are the amendments to the accompanying measures.
The introduction of concrete spheres of responsibility and the possibility of employing temporary staff are first steps in the right direction.
We firmly support these amendments, and this is also why we voted for this report.
