Mr President, it was in fact with great regret that I voted against some of the amendments tabled by my friends in the ARE Group because in principle they were certainly right.
In justification I would therefore say that we studied this question at length in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy.
For we are in fact looking at two things here.
On the one hand we are looking at external security, for which we must now be prepared to give something.
For if we leave the North Koreans to get on alone with their nuclear development, something dreadful will come out of it.
So we have to try to become involved here and exert control.
As for the second point, there is something we must realise: there is unimaginable misery in North Korea.
Mr Tindemans has just been there and has reported back to us.
It is quite atrocious, almost worse than ever seen before.
We must find ways of providing humanitarian assistance.
I believe that is necessary in spite of all our reservations and in spite of our abhorrence of the North Korean regime.
We should be prepared to help a little and see if we can alleviate even to some small extent the dreadful misery of what are in other respects really very decent people.
