Since I cannot split myself in two, I now have to give my position on Jean-Louis Bourlanges's report.
The strategic approach to restructuring this budget must focus on internal and foreign policies because they account for a large share of compulsory expenditure and multiannual programmes.
So I very much welcome our joint call for an increase in the share of development policies in the Community budget.
But we must bear in mind that the development impact of each euro must be enhanced with a view to sustainability, and here I mean both ecological and economic sustainability.
More emphasis must now be laid on good governance as a condition for granting any aid that goes beyond emergency aid.
We must look more closely at the macro-economic impact of our food aid and put the interests of the agricultural budget in second place.
I would remind you of our debate on aid for Russia.
And as the World Bank notes in its report on 'Assessing Aid', development aid should where possible be multilateral, which means it should also be shifted from the Member States to the Union.
But if we are to remain credible, we should also say where we are prepared to economise, which in my view should primarily be in relation to the disputed KEDO project.
But we must also radically rethink the export promotion programmes, not just with a view to creating European added value but also against the backdrop of the question of whether this should be an object of common European action in the first place.
How willing are we in fact to be serious about what we have been demanding for days, namely concentration on the essentials?
I very much hope that with the dialogue on Jean-Louis Bourlanges's report and priorities we will be able to take a major step forward in regard to development policy.
