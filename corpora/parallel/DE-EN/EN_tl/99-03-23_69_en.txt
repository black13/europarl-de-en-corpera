Mr President, I think we really do now have a classic example of the problems involved in the European programmes.
A good, indeed an essential programme, is simply not a carte blanche for mismanagement.
During the last discussion we also said that in the interests of Leonardo II it was urgently necessary that Mrs Cresson put her house in order.
The situation has turned out to be rather more acute in the meantime, but the house is being put in order.
In that respect, we are seeing progress.
Leonardo II has made it possible to create the European dimension of vocational training, to give access to lifelong learning, not just as a slogan for those who lack qualifications but as an opportunity.
Here Parliament has a special responsibility to bring about progress through dialogue with the Council.
Of course we have to consider how we can effectively resolve the question of public accountability for the use of public monies.
We will not be able simply to fall back on old models of public administration.
They are no longer appropriate.
We need modern models that also use the instruments of contract awarding.
But that cannot mean handing over the money to industry or to mafia-like structures and letting them manage it themselves.
That is bound to lead to the results we have seen.
We must put an end to that.
We need to return to public accountability.
That is the central task to which the Council and Parliament must now apply themselves together and which the new Commission must resolve.
I hope the caretaker Commission will take supportive action towards this aim.
