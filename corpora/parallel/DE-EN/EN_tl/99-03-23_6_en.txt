Madam President, since 1985 we have had a directive regulating compensation for people who have suffered damage from defective products.
With the current proposal, the Commission is intending to increase consumer protection in regard to the safety of food and primary agricultural products.
In this extremely sensitive area, the directive is to be extended so that it also covers agricultural raw materials, which were excluded until now.
Amendments Nos 1 and 2 must certainly be supported, because they ensure that those who produce genetically modified seeds can also be held responsible for any consequences.
Farmers must not be held liable for damage for which the large undertakings are responsible.
Unfortunately, the Commission proposal was also used as an opportunity to table certain amendments that seriously impinge on national civil law and have no real basis.
That is why we cannot endorse the extension of the directive to cover agricultural products.
