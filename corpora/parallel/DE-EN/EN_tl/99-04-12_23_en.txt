Mr President, firstly we must thank all the rapporteurs for their work, as these reports deal with an area at the very heart of European values, namely the principle of the rule of law.
I believe it is very important that we remind ourselves that social mobility and the integration of the people of Europe must be accompanied by harmonisation of the law.
In my opinion, therefore, it is not a disadvantage but in fact important that we should bring our civil law and in particular our criminal law into line in response to the fact that we in Europe are living increasingly close together.
I also consider it important that we place great emphasis on legal culture not being lost in practice.
This applies in particular to future members in Central and Eastern Europe.
We are already seeing in the accession talks and preparations that it is very difficult there to identify, support or promote a legal culture that allows people to live together in a common economic and legal framework and in an area of freedom and democracy.
With regard to fundamental rights, I would say the following.
Mr Nassauer referred to Europol.
It is very important for us to have effective policing instruments, but they must be accompanied by judicial and parliamentary monitoring instruments.
In my view it is not enough that only the national parliaments should fulfil this role.
The European Court of Justice and in future also the European Parliament should have a very crucial monitoring function here.
My last point concerns the right of asylum.
It is very important for Europe to be open and we must ensure that asylum does not fall by the wayside.
We must also ensure that the burden is shared fairly within the European Community.
The right of asylum must be considered as a sacred European value.
We will not tolerate anything less.
