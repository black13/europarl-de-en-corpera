Mr President, as the rapporteur, Mr Nassauer, has already said, parliamentary supervision of Europol's police activities of is one of the most important tasks of this House, particularly for us as politicians concerned with home affairs.
For this reason we in the Green Group in the European Parliament consider it to be very important that Europol, as an intergovernmental organisation, does not acquire any additional powers that would be inconceivable for our national police authorities and that violate the rights of EU citizens.
An example is the Protocol on the privileges and immunities of Europol.
Of course we are in favour of Europol as a European authority that is necessary for the internal security of the European Union and plays a crucial role in cooperation between national police authorities.
But we are in favour of a European authority that can be democratically controlled.
Police activity needs to be supervised above all in areas where it interferes with civil rights, especially fundamental rights.
For this reason we are not satisfied with the current supervision of Europol that is supposedly carried out by the national parliaments.
Mr Nassauer has made some good proposals, which we welcome.
But they are not sufficient.
In our opinion it is very important that parliamentary supervision of Europol's police activities should be carried out by the European Parliament, but there are unfortunately still no proposals that would allow us to exercise genuine control.
