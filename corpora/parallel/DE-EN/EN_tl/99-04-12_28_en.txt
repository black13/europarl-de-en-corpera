Mr President, the prospect of Europol as an effective instrument to combat organised crime has been held out for longer than I have been in this House.
Yet it has still not been set up.
The preparatory work has not yet progressed far enough to allow it to become fully operational in The Hague.
Of course we are all interested in a functional Europol as an appropriate weapon against organised crime.
It is generally recognised that we need an effective instrument in the fight against crime that is increasing particularly in qualitative terms.
However, instead of vehemently demanding that the preparatory work be concluded, today we are discussing a development that goes too far and, in our opinion, in the wrong direction.
The security aspect does not require Europol officers to be given the right to issue instructions to national officers, not does it require the setting-up of a central European body.
For these reasons we reject the report.
