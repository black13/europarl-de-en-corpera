Mr President, my group supports the reports by Mrs Zimmermann and Mrs Reding.
Even in the last few days it has become clear once again how urgently we need a European policy on refugees and immigration.
The atrocities, the expulsion and the genocide in Kosovo and the sometimes unpleasant way in which some Member States are dealing with the displaced persons who need our support illustrate once again that we need a harmonised policy on refugees and asylum, but one that must be humane in accordance with the Geneva Convention.
The harmonised minimum level for certain services and reception facilities must apply to all EU Member States.
We cannot have a situation in which some countries, like my country, Germany, bear a far heavier burden than others.
This also applies to the area of migrant labour.
Mrs Reding's report contains some very welcome demands for a differentiated approach involving three groups: refugees, migrant labour and the victims of smuggling networks.
I would like to thank Mrs Reding on behalf of my group for presenting such a differentiated report.
With regard to what Mr Pirker said, it is not true that we did not or do not want a report on Eurodac.
We wanted a report but not the one that Mr Pirker has given us.
We would have liked to have discussed and adopted a critical report, which is what our voters elected us to do and expect of us.
When it comes to civil rights and avoiding the same old arguments we have a huge responsibility, even here in the House.
That is why we rejected his report: because it was not appropriate for this House.
