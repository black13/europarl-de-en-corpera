Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in international competition we need a sensible form of energy taxation.
In my opinion there are several reasons why the issue of energy taxation is one of the most forward-looking debates in the European Union and beyond.
Positively speaking, it mainly involves a system of incentives to encourage an economical and efficient use of our resources.
But we must proceed with restraint to ensure that the baby - and therefore the economy - is not thrown out with the bathwater.
After all, we are not against the introduction of harmonised energy taxation in principle.
However, with it we must guarantee a level playing field in terms of competition.
My country, for example, has taken a leading role in this area.
Accordingly, the general introduction of upper limits on taxation for energy-intensive firms, as provided in Article 15 of the Commission proposal, makes a great deal of sense.
We should not forget that such firms have already in the past updated their technical equipment and brought their energy consumption closer to minimum levels.
In this case higher energy tax cannot achieve any further saving.
We can prevent the increased costs that this would entail and thus support the competitiveness of our companies and of Europe as a location for business.
For this reason we should also think about discontinuing the optional exemption of energy products that are not used as fuel and of energy products that are used to produce electricity and heat, as provided in Article 13.
In any case, those Member States whose energy taxation rates are above the minimum level should at least be given the opportunity to adjust their taxation levels accordingly.
A flexible system of upper limits could make it possible to find reasonable solutions.
