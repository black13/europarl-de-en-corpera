Efforts to successfully combat international crime are right and proper.
Any obstruction of effective prosecution by an individual Member State must be prevented, so that public safety can be guaranteed.
However, this does not justify the creation of a supranational authority which would intrude heavily on the authority of the individual Member States and thus flagrantly impair their sovereignty.
Effective prosecution can only be guaranteed by the authorities on the spot.
For these reasons, although I voted in favour of the report, I voted against the proposed appointment of a European public prosecutor in the final vote.
