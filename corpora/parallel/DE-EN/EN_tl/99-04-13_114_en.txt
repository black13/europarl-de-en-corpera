Mr President, Commissioner, given the time, I should like to confine my comments to the Peres report.
Amending and correcting the regulation on the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables is extremely important.
In my view, serious questions need to be asked about the waiver from the obligation to supply producer organisations for products which are marketed directly by the producer.
This method of selling by means of direct marketing has traditionally had a very special status in Germany, which I myself have strongly supported for many years.
You said this morning, Commissioner, that this is the second marketing year that the new regime for fruit and vegetables has been in force.
Unfortunately, however, I have discovered that the Commission only takes the waiver in the market organisation to mean sales on the producer's holding.
What is the position for sales in the field, at the roadside or at the weekly market?
This extremely restrictive interpretation is the result of a letter from Mr Legrand of the Commission.
You are nodding; it seems then that there have been more recent developments.
That would certainly be welcome.
The proportion of goods permitted to be marketed directly is supposed to remain unchanged at 20 % of the produce of each Member State.
In this context, one of the issues we discussed in the Agriculture Committee was how it is proposed to check up on this.
Is it not the case that implementing this system in agricultural holdings will actually be extremely difficult?
If you consider agricultural practice, for example at asparagus or strawberry time, you might be forgiven for thinking that a certain amount of idealism is at work here.
I do not believe that the rule of the game should be direct sales when demand is high and the producer organisation when demand is slack.
But the monitoring of the whole scheme seems to me to have been too theoretically conceived.
