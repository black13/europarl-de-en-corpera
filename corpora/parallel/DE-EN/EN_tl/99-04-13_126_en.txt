Mr President, there is a gap in the EWC directive; that became only too clear during the strike at Vilvoorde, as previous speakers have already pointed out.
Clarification is needed on what information requirements actually exist.
This is provided in the important and very fine piece of work produced by Mrs Ghilardotti.
Of course compromises have had to be made.
We particularly regret one of them: it is absurd enough as it is to bring company size into play where obligations to provide information are concerned, and then on top of that, 50 is far too high a figure.
We have therefore given Parliament another opportunity to go further and have tabled an amendment proposing 20 as the threshold, well aware that actually this figure is absurd as well.
As far as the protection of certain interest groups is concerned, we really have to say once again that this is a problem in any case because, for example, the freedom of the press is not the freedom of the newspaper owner, but the freedom of journalists.
In churches too, church members have freedoms and these also need to be protected.
But when it comes to information rights, this cannot have anything to do with the protection of certain interest groups.
In German law, protection is provided for certain interest groups in joint decision making.
There is some confusion here.
If UNICE is now complaining that it is being ignored, then it ought to have cooperated constructively!
