Mr President, first of all I should like to thank the two rapporteurs.
This is a difficult subject and they have both done a fine job.
So thank you very much, Mr Chanterie and Mr McMahon!
I can only agree with Mr van Velzen.
We cannot exclude sectors from legislation of this kind just because they are problematic.
One reason for this is the health of the workers.
When I consider the demanding jobs done by mobile workers and self-employed drivers, I cannot see any difference between employees and self-employed drivers in terms of danger to health.
I believe that protection needs to be provided for both groups.
Of course this also applies to seafarers on board ships, offshore workers and in particular doctors, who certainly do not have an easy job.
That is one reason, the workers' health.
The other is of course safety, and unfortunately this also affects those who do not work in these sectors.
You see, if an overtired lorry driver runs into my car, although I am driving properly, that is certainly not exactly good for me.
If a ship carrying oil - and this is something we have experienced - runs aground because the master is asleep, this puts the whole environment at risk.
It is therefore very easy to see the wider implications of the safety issue.
I think that for this reason alone, this is very, very important.
Mr van Velzen, I think that we should actually make renewed efforts within the two large groups - and perhaps with all the others who are willing to cooperate - to reach compromises on the amendments.
I would see this as particularly important in these two areas.
I also hope that we find a reasonable solution to the Sunday rest issue, one which the Commission is also able to endorse, without the European Court of Justice raising difficulties once again.
