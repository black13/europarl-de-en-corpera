Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission proposal now before us is based on the 1993 working time directive and concerns the sectors and activities which were excluded from it.
We know from the background to the process of adopting that directive that it met with considerable resistance in the Council.
This change is intended to bring the sectors which were excluded - some of them without good reason - within the scope of the directive.
Of course, like previous speakers, I am concerned about protecting the health and safety of both employees and the others who are affected.
At the same time, this begs the question of whether having extended and all-embracing rules at European level is compatible with the principle of subsidiarity.
This week we shall also be discussing the need to modernise the organisation of work.
Working time is an essential part of this.
We know from statistics how much working time varies across our European countries, and that it is dependent on factors such as production technology and particular cultural features.
European legislation applying to all sectors and to the whole of Europe should not stand in the way of these traditions.
I also have a comment on Sunday rest: in my opinion, Sunday rest is particularly important in today's restless world, especially for family life, social occasions, keeping up traditions and for clubs and organisations.
