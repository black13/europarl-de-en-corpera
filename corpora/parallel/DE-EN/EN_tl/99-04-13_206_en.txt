Madam President, the discussion about the incineration of waste and hazardous waste has shown once again how far our society still is from recognising the principle that the polluter should pay for environmental damage.
On the one hand, we have endless discussions about the competitive disadvantages that result for industry, particularly for the disposal industry.
On the other hand, it is exceptionally difficult to revise the limit values for highly toxic substances downwards.
Yet some countries, including Austria, have proved that it can be done.
Mr Blokland's excellent report is certainly a corrective to the Commission's draft.
In future, however, we will have no choice but to get involved in the basic discussion on the design of all production processes from the manufacture of a product to its final disposal.
The closest attention must be paid to ensuring that any products and resulting compounds whose disposal can have serious consequences, particularly illnesses, cannot be produced or put on the market in the first place.
