Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we must thank Mr Blokland particularly for the enormous work he has done, as we have now been working on the issue of waste incineration for one and a half years in committee to ensure that it is dealt with carefully.
I believe we all agree that there must be stringent guidelines for limit values for waste incineration.
However, a number of amendments pursue very ambitious objectives that I cannot support, as we must realise that they involve huge costs.
That would in turn create a new incentive - with record cases of avoidance and criminal offences - because waste disposal would then be extremely expensive.
I would like to comment further on the issue of the different types of waste.
In this area too we have witnessed significant abuse in the past because we did not have a uniform definition of waste, and because of the different definitions we were constantly faced with cases of avoidance.
In this respect I must say that in my view the idea of combining the two directives into one is not bad because it is much easier to work with one law than to have to comply with two different laws, and because it different rules and different interpretations.
In other words, I am in favour of a single directive but I am not in favour of all the strict guidelines that have been suggested, as these are not feasible.
On the other hand, it is high time that we had a clear policy on waste disposal, and I believe that we have created a good basis for this.
I am keen to see the outcome of tomorrow's vote, and I am also interested to know the Commissioner's views on the various amendments.
