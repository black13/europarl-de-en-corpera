Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the environment programme 'LIFE' is the European Union's most important instrument for the financing of environmental projects.
It is thanks only to the action of the European Parliament that we now have access to considerable funding from the European budget, at any rate ECU 613 million for the next five years.
Important though the goals are that were proposed by the European Commission for LIFE-Environment, I feel that it is urgently necessary, in view of the problems that exist and the priorities repeatedly called for by the European Parliament, to mention the objectives of air and water pollution too.
If these were not included the result would be that projects based on these objectives would receive practically no funding over the next five years.
In the light of the discussion in the House on climatic disasters and water pollution, this must not be the case.
There is a link here with a request which our group made as early as five years ago, that only those projects that are really new in terms of the current state of technological progress should be assisted, the problem being that currently, in certain regions of the Community, projects can be funded that are at a level of technological development already commonplace in other regions.
This should not become common practice in future in view of the scarce resources available.
My group considers all projects funded by LIFE to be extremely important, of course, but we also fully support the objectives proposed by the Commission, such as the 'starter' and 'co-op' measures.
However, I also considered it important in this context to promote measures for the targeted conversion and development of areas and their land use, which are necessary to protect species and biotopes.
These are the subject of another four amendments tabled by our group, and I would be grateful if they could be supported.
