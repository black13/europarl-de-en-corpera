Madam President, in principle the LIFE programme is extremely welcome from an environmental point of view.
The most important prerequisite for success is sufficient funding.
But we have just seen from the case of Altener II that environmental programmes are the first to come under threat where cuts are made in funding.
Almost every type of environmental initiative also creates jobs.
The involvement of the applicant countries in the LIFE programme is of enormous importance.
But we must not forget that these countries do not always have the necessary determination to improve the overall environmental situation.
The European Union should therefore signal to these countries that their own efforts in the whole area of environmental protection are an essential condition for closer relations and, finally, accession to the European Union.
In these countries there is the danger that environmental dumping is practised both in industry and in energy production.
The improvement in the dissemination of information on LIFE projects and the associated increase in budget appropriations from 3 % to 5 % are also to be welcomed.
