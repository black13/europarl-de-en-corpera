Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the difficulties facing European agriculture are sufficiently well known.
They are of course being discussed at this very moment.
Small-scale farmers have problems competing directly with factory farms overseas.
I am favourably disposed towards the idea of selling more quality products from European agriculture on the world markets by means of the measures proposed in the Fantuzzi report.
However, as with all support policies, two points need to be taken into account here.
Firstly, we must ensure that no new bureaucratic bodies are created.
There is already a proliferation of forums and committees.
I am therefore critical of the proposal to arrange our own trade visits.
It begs the question of whether associations already in existence might not be able to perform this task.
Secondly, the financial burden and the risk must not be borne predominantly by the public sector.
Only if the operators also bear a considerable proportion of the costs will sensible projects be implemented without public money being wasted.
That is why the amendment stating that the Community should pay 60 % of the costs in each case rather than a maximum of 50 % is not acceptable.
Overall, I believe that the measures will unlock new sales potential for our farmers.
I therefore support the Commission proposal.
