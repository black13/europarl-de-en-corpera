Mr President, the CDU and the CSU were obliged to vote against the Reding report, because it was rendered unacceptable by amendments from the left.
We regret that the important issues of asylum seekers and refugees from civil war are linked time and again to various ideological demands: see Amendment No 12 on voting rights and so forth.
This makes it more difficult for us to help in real emergencies.
The hypocrisy of those who vote in favour of amendments of this kind is intolerable, since it is precisely they who are then not prepared in cases such as that of the Kosovo refugees and displaced persons to take in their share of displaced persons.
Take France, for example: Mr Jospin has not taken in anyone from Kosovo.
In Bavaria, we have already created the capacity for 7 000 people.
This is about us providing real and practical help and not continuing to overburden this important subject with our own ideological and unrealistic desires.
If this continues to happen and there is a real emergency, we will remain inflexible, we will not be able to help, and we will provoke unwelcome public opinion.
That is why I call on the left of the House finally to reach a consensus on these issues.
