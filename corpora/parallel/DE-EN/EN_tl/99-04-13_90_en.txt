We are voting in favour of the Cox report because these ecotaxes are a logical political measure which make sense under certain conditions.
However, some important steps first need to be taken:
a fundamental tax reform with a general reduction in overall tax revenue; - targeted measures; - a clear promotion of renewable sources of energy.The ecotaxes, conceived as a policy instrument, should under no circumstances degenerate into a means of tapping new sources of revenue.
That is also why we reject Amendment No 6.
