By this means, I wished to emphasise once again that I clearly see that the lack of parliamentary supervision of Europol is a problem, and that any steps to resolve this have my full support.
I have of course also voted in favour of these points.
However, I think that the approach adopted in the report, of putting Europol under the supervision of a Commissioner and thus under the supervision of the European Parliament, is the wrong one.
I certainly cannot agree to Europol having higher status than national officers either: this is unacceptable.
For these reasons, I voted against the report in the final vote.
