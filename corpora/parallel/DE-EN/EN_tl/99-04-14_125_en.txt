Mr President, 'war', it says today in a German daily, 'is always the result of a policy that has not achieved its aim'.
That is why the generals should only intervene after the politicians have failed.
But what does a military leadership do if it has been instructed to win a war without waging a war?
At present the necessary military action by NATO has been taken on the responsibility of a group of politicians who once upon a time loudly proclaimed themselves pacifists and opponents of war in the peace movements and are now ordering a war without wanting to dirty their hands.
There is clearly a wide gap between instructions and means here.
If peace is to be achieved by political means then the military have to withdraw.
If it is to be achieved by military means the politicians must withdraw.
At present the two areas of responsibility are being confused in an unprofessional manner and two half-measures certainly do not make a whole.
In addition to the aggressor, those who are incapable of intervening at the right moment with the right methods also bear responsibility for the plight of the people.
