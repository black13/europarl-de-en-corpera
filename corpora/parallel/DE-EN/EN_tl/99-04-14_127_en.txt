Mr President, I have listened very carefully indeed to this discussion.
People keep saying things that no longer bear any relation to reality.
They say we must return to the negotiating table.
Think how long we went on negotiating, without any result except that the situation became ever worse.
We must finally look at the situation realistically and realise that if we want to be credible we have to take a credible democratic stance.
That means realising that people are not there for countries, but countries for people.
So if we expect the Kosovars to return under the rule of those who drove them out of their homes and murdered their families, we are asking something humanly impossible.
We should finally be totally realistic and pragmatic.
People keep saying that ground troops could perhaps be deployed.
I think that is a big mistake because European ground troops have often failed in their aims in this region.
But the Kosovars are in their home country.
I myself saw in Croatia - and I was often in Croatia during the time of the war - that the Croats were successful when they had more or less the same weapons as the Serbs.
They chased them out, for people who are defending their own territory are far stronger than the aggressors who always come with a bad conscience.
Finally, let me say something encouraging.
People keeping asking what will then become of the Serbs.
First of all, Milosevic is not Serbia.
The Serbs are not Milosevic, just as the Germans were not Hitler.
But we must finally realise that we cannot make peace with Milosevic because he will only start to commit his crimes all over again.
Secondly, we must do our utmost to ensure that the policy pursued here is based on realism and not on illusion.
