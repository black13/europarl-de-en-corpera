Mr President, I too want to join in the thanks to the two rapporteurs, Mr BÃ¶ge and Mrs Roth-Behrendt, and to Mrs Bonino and her staff.
Thanks to the work of the Committee of Inquiry into BSE and the restructuring and changes made by the Commission, we have now anticipated what will soon enter into force under the Treaty of Amsterdam, namely preventive health and consumer protection.
That is a very important foundation on which to build sustainable development of the Union.
I believe that we must continue to follow up the question of the precautionary principle which we have now anchored in our legislation and that we will also have to incorporate the principles of transparency and of separation of powers, which we now have in the Union, in international treaties and agreements too.
In that way we can achieve preventive health and consumer protection not only for the people in our Union but also in relation to products from other countries that end up in the Union.
I think Parliament must call on the Commission to show this same transparency in the preparations for the negotiations on these international treaties.
So we need more information: what is the nature of these preparations, who is making them, what are the ultimate objectives, how can they be achieved or have they already been realised?
There is a further point I find most regrettable.
As rapporteur for the Green Paper on the future of food legislation I had also expected a stronger thrust in that direction.
I hope we will still manage to achieve modern food legislation prior to enlargement of the Union.
