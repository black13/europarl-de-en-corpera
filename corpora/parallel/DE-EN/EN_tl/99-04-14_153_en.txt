Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today I want to give very special thanks to Mr BÃ¶ge and Mrs Roth-Behrendt for their truly thorough work in the Committee of Inquiry into BSE and afterwards too.
The BSE scandal plunged the entire European Union into a deep crisis.
It was demonstrated to us quite plainly that even for the people of today, there are limits that have to be respected.
Nature has its laws and it is only within that framework that we can and may proceed if we want to make progress for the benefit of mankind.
Unfortunately we have still not come to the end of the crisis into which that irresponsible behaviour plunged us, and it will probably take decades before we know its true scale.
Today I will not fail to express my respect for the Commission under President Jacques Santer for having the courage and the staying-power to uncover, in the face of resistance in the Member States, the scandalous abuses whose origins after all reach back to the mid-1980s.
Even though the scandal has long since been exposed and has now almost disappeared from the media, I would nevertheless point out that we must not forget the BSE tragedy.
So it will be most important to ensure that the next Commission constantly presents its activities before Parliament.
Especially when public health is at issue, we must not take any risks.
As elected representatives it is our duty to stand up for the people.
Let me say very frankly, Commissioner, that I am deeply disturbed because I believe that we can still not gauge today how many new cases of BSE and also of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease we will encounter in the coming years.
