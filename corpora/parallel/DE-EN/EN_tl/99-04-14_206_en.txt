Thank you, Mr President-in-Office.
As you know, this morning Chancellor Schr√∂der announced a new intergovernmental conference, which is to end again next year.
I just want to ask whether this intergovernmental conference is to be given a mandate even before the Amsterdam Treaty enters into force and which specific parts of the Amsterdam Treaty will be renegotiable there.
