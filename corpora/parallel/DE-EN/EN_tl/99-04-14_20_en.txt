Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the Berlin summit is a text-book example of how dangerous it is for the Community when national interests take precedence and joint progress takes second place.
But this time things still went well.
The summit did not produce a reform but at least it produced a package which will allow the Union to get through the next few years.
The summit did in fact produce one important signal for the future of Europe.
It fixed a binding, early date for enlargement.
That sent out a necessary signal to the applicant countries and their people.
It spurred them on in their reform process.
Peace is an expensive asset.
That is why I can only repeat that Europe's future lies in overcoming attempts to draw new frontiers and the domination of national interests.
But at the same time the Berlin summit drew up a timetable for institutional reform, so that the Union can become capable of enlargement in the first place.
I hope the Council will then recognise that Parliament has equal rights and finally accord it more powers and the right of initiative.
That is the precondition for overcoming the blockage of unanimous decisions.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, just imagine if you had to hand out 20 or 25 presents to ensure that everyone agreed.
More rights for Parliament means closeness to the people and democracy for the European Union.
That is the future: a Europe that is all of a piece, that is social, ecological and democratic.
That is what we want and that is what we must achieve!
