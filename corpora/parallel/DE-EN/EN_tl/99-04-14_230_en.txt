Mr President-in-Office, this is not the first time this question is being discussed here in the European Parliament either.
It has often come up during Question Time.
Questions of this kind have been put very often and I must tell you quite honestly that your reply, namely that you could not provide any further information in response to further supplementaries, is very unsatisfactory as far as Parliament is concerned.
Let me perhaps point out the following and ask you to take it further or even to provide some information if possible.
We must always look at Gibraltar in terms of two different legal systems, because after all we know that Gibraltar's existing borders do not correspond to its historical borders.
That is to say, there is a part of Gibraltar that is undoubtedly part of Great Britain and another part, the northern part, which is, if you like, Spanish territory under British administration.
So would it not be possible, for example, at least to grant the right to vote to those people who live in the Spanish territory that comes under British administration?
Surely at least that should be possible!
