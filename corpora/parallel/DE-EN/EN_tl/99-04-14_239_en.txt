Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, indeed we know that the MED-TV channel and the newspaper Özgür Politika provide very in-depth information.
And we know the subject matter.
Does the Council in fact plan also to use these channels to provide information to the Kurds who live in our countries?
My second question is this: what means are currently being applied to integrate the Kurds in Europe?
