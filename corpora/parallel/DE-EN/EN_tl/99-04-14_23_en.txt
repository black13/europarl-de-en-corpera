Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the Berlin summit took place under difficult institutional and international conditions, which meant that less time could be devoted to the Agenda 2000 reform package than would have been generally necessary.
Against the background of the Kosovo conflict, every other policy area simply becomes relatively less urgent.
On Agenda 2000: expenditure was stabilised in the structural field, although this meant fairly major shifts in the definition of financial priorities within the structural measures, such as the increase of cohesion resources by as much as EUR 3 billion.
At any rate, for the new Objective 2, which is intended among other things to promote rural development, the support has been cut by 5 %.
I cannot help thinking that the support could have been concentrated on the neediest regions, considering that more than EUR 4 bn of financial treats were distributed all over Europe.
Yet the Berlin conclusions do represent a response to the further financing of the existing Community of 15 and of an enlarged Europe.
On the one hand the Council calls on the Commission to take energetic action to create new, autonomous own resources.
Elsewhere it equally clearly lays down that the financial perspective needs to be adjusted, incidentally by a qualified Council majority.
That also explains the statements by your colleague Mr Wemheuer and by President Santer of the Commission, who both said that the current agreement would soon have be followed by another reform.
So I do not share the view of some Members of this House that the adoption of Agenda 2000 really is a great success.
