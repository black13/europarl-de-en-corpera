Ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to support Otto von Habsburg, who said that we should make haste if we are not to miss a historic opportunity.
And I believe that this is very important.
When I visit the applicant counties, I am struck by their failure to understand our hesitation.
For example, they cannot grasp why we are not full of enthusiasm once a date has been set for possible accession, 2002 in the case of Hungary.
Of course, it is evident that meeting the criteria is essential for accession.
And it is clear that they are making good progress in many areas, the economy for example, and also with the democratic and political criteria.
Amazingly enough, the same cannot be said of other areas, such as administrative reform and above all legal reform.
Sometimes it is not easy to explain to them that to have an effective legal culture prevailing within the judicial system and in the courts is simply essential for a properly functioning internal market, just as democracy is of course a requirement for political union.
We must use great powers of persuasion here.
On the other hand, we need to be extraordinarily careful about the kind of criticisms we make, so that they do not have the opposite of the desired effect.
As it is, we often have the impression that not only do they not want to hear such criticism at all - and who does? - but that it even wounds their national pride and is counterproductive.
However, there is no doubt at all about one point: we have to make it perfectly clear that we have every interest in these accessions taking place as quickly as possible once the criteria have been met.
We should not transfer our difficulties to them and behave as if we were afraid of their economy and their people.
That is the heart of the matter, and that is why we must make sure that these accessions happen as soon as possible once the criteria have been fulfilled.
We need to make that crystal clear in all our discussions.
Applause
