Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to say a few words about Malta.
First, I would like to thank everyone who has helped to ensure that Malta is once again being considered alongside the other applicant countries, as envisaged at the Corfu and Essen Councils.
I would also like to thank you in particular, Commissioner van den Broek, for the firm support you have offered ever since the present Maltese Government reactivated their country's application for membership.
However, I have a few questions for the Commission on this.
My first question is about the Task Force for the Accession Negotiations, which includes a special unit for each country.
When will the unit responsible for Malta start work?
My second question is about the fourth financial protocol.
According to this protocol the 1999 budget provides EUR 5 million each for Malta and Cyprus.
But with the help of the Commission and before the recent elections in Malta, it had been agreed that the financial protocol for Malta would be extended by a further year.
Now, several million euros are not available, because they were not included in the budget.
Do you see any chance, perhaps by using the Notenboom procedure or some other method, of implementing this extended financial protocol now?
My third comment is on the report before us.
I am very sorry that the rapporteur did not consider it necessary to be present for this debate.
I am referring to the amendments tabled on the report.
It seems to me that Amendment No 1, which takes the Maltese authorities and administration up on their promise to respect the vote in favour of membership of the European Union, is aimed at the wrong people.
After all, with Norway we saw that it was ultimately the public who decided what would happen, without anyone making the authorities responsible beforehand.
Overall, I am very grateful that we have had this debate here today.
