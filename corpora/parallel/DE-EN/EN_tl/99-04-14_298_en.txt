Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are today debating one part of the overall package of reforms in European competition law.
Mirroring the trend in the United States since the end of the last century, the European Union's anti-trust authority has become the spearhead of the EU.
We need rules to safeguard the free market and to provide protection against monopolistic situations.
Only competition can guarantee the lowest possible price for the consumer, quality, free access to the market, and, of course, innovation and jobs.
Commissioner, you quite rightly referred several times to the support which Parliament has offered up to now in its contacts with the relevant departments.
The Commission can also count on Parliament playing a constructive part in future work on the reform of competition law.
This of course includes a detailed analysis of the present communication which deals with vertical restraints on distribution.
As a matter of principle, it is of course right to frame practical block exemption regulations.
Let me say it again, practical.
It is probably easier to assess the internal market situation by judging the impact of vertical agreements than by applying strict formal criteria, particularly as small economic operators would then benefit from simplified formalities.
And we would be well advised to convince all sectors of the need for such a reform.
The rapporteur, Marianne Thyssen, quite rightly points out that there is absolutely no obstacle either to exceptions being made or to sector-specific approaches being adopted for those sectors in which the existing arrangements work to the total satisfaction of economic operators.
Some distributional restraints reflect an economic requirement, for example because of the scale of investment or the consequent rate of return.
At any rate, changes in sensitive areas should involve appropriate transitional periods.
In my country alone, assets measurable in billions are dependent on this approach.
