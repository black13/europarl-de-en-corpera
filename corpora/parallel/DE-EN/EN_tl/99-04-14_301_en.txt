Mr President, I have one more question, or rather a request for clarification.
I would have been interested to know, and this has already been touched upon, how geographical catchment areas are to be defined for economic operators.
How do you define local, regional, national and pan-European?
It seems to me that this is an essential criterion for exemption, so perhaps we could have a written answer.
