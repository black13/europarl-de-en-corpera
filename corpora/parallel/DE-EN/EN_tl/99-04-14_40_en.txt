Madam President, Berlin was worth the journey, as we have heard here today several times.
But it will take a lot more work before the objectives set out by the Berlin European Council have an impact on the ground.
That applies in particular to the important issue for the future, 'enlargement', which has rightly been addressed repeatedly here today.
The slogan here runs: rather than drawing away in fear we must move towards one another.
In an exemplary joint effort, the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament have made the Interreg Community initiative stand as a signal for cooperation beyond the existing external border of the EU.
Many thanks, Commissioner!
Now we must ensure that European legal texts and European aid money lead to constructive cooperation between the people on either side of the EU border.
In my own country, Austria, as also in other Member States bordering on the applicant countries, we have an opportunity to turn the idea of European cooperation into reality with concrete projects.
Let us do so!
We also have this kind of very concrete cooperation between the European institutions and the European people in my own country at present, on a different European issue, the question of the refugees in and from Kosovo.
In Austria the people themselves, vigorously supported by the media, by radio, TV and the press, have sent out their own very personal European signal in the form of an exemplary action called 'Neighbour in Need'.
In the space of a few days the people - first and foremost it is the ordinary people, who find it hard enough to live on their incomes as it is - have already donated more than 100 million Austrian schillings.
That is tangible proof of the European solidarity that we, the political office-holders in Europe, all too often call for in word alone.
We, the Council and Parliament as the European budgetary authority, should take a leaf from their book.
Applause
