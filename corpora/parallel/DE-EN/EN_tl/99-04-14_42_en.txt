Madam President, the basic agreement reached in Berlin about the agricultural part of Agenda 2000 contradicts the statement by the Commission that it wants to make European agriculture more competitive and therefore viable.
The partial adoption by the Council of the Commission's price cutting proposals in the milk, cereals and beef and veal sector will bring these prices closer to the world market level, but the proposed compensatory payments go no way near to covering the income losses.
Now we are told the milk market reform is only to begin in the year 2005, in three phases, and that the quota system is to expire in 2008.
We welcome the idea of optional set-aside.
That is something we called for.
In the case of cereals too, the agreements will initially run only until the year 2002, when adjustments are to be made if necessary.
Further price cuts of 5 % are under discussion, but on the basis that then the compensation could be raised again from EUR 63 to EUR 66 a tonne.
But obviously nobody noticed that this hit the oilseed farmers particularly hard.
After the compromise reached by the agriculture ministers, they were sure of obtaining EUR 66, but now it will only be 63.
On the other hand we welcome the fact that set-aside is still fixed at 10 % until the year 2006.
In regard to beef and veal, the Agenda decisions resolve neither the surplus nor the income problem.
The mother-cow breeders have won, the traditional bull-fatteners have lost.
That is the simple outcome of the Agenda, my dear President-in-Office of the Council!
