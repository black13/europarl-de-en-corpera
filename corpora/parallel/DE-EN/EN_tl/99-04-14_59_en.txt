Madam President, I rise to speak on the Happart report.
We agree with the price proposals in the report because for legal reasons they are vital to protecting farm incomes.
But I want to point out that the package is not sufficient to protect farmers' ability to survive, as agricultural prices are staying the same, while the general price level is rising constantly as a result of inflation.
That brings down farm incomes - in Austria it brought them down by 1.7 % in 1997 - while raising incomes in, for example, industry.
