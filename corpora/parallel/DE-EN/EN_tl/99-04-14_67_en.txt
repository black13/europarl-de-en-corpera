Madam President, I welcome the intention to introduce measures to promote and provide information on agricultural products in third countries because I consider these instruments absolutely necessary if we want to continue to withstand international competition.
The EU must pursue an active export policy that goes beyond the use of export refunds and can have a positive impact on the sales of agricultural products over and above the existing export refunds.
Given the importance of this regulation, let me point out that the funding allocated and the financing procedures must be adequate.
There should be a special budget to ensure that this export policy instrument has a real impact.
Since I consider it important to ensure that the measures can be applied in practice, I have vehemently opposed the introduction of a new management committee.
