Madam President, I would like to give an explanation of vote on the Ghilardotti and Chanterie reports on aspects of social policy.
I believe we all need to reconsider as a matter of principle to what extent we want to deal with certain policy areas at European level.
I voted against both reports because in my view we should not create a kind of social union within the European Union.
We should not be aiming at a tax union.
We need state influence at national level; but we do not need it at European level at the same time.
Labour market policy should be organised at national level.
According to both reports, the labour market should be regulated Europe-wide by means of consultation rights being granted Europe-wide and working time rules applying Europe-wide, as proposed in the Chanterie report.
I believe we should keep to national rules in this area.
We do not have to regulate everything at European level.
We do not need to imitate the nation-state at European level.
That is why I am against these two 'social policy' reports.
Chanterie report (A4-0184/99)
