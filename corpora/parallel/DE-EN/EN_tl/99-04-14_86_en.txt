Madam President, we voted for the report because the integration of the two directives on incinerating hazardous and non-hazardous waste is to be welcomed.
However, we very much regretted that Parliament did not adopt the Greens' amendment aimed at a zero-emission limit value for dioxin in water.
We know that dioxin is the most dangerous chemical mankind has ever produced.
Following new scientific findings, the WHO has also drawn attention to this problem of the maximum permissible level for humans and reduced its limit values.
So I cannot understand why Parliament has not followed an early Commission proposal.
I regard this high level of dioxin pollution as a kind of Waterloo in health terms.
I think it is totally irresponsible for Parliament not to accept these proposals, for this in fact means it has bowed to the pressure from industry.
In the case of a substance as dangerous as the Seveso poison dioxin, I find that difficult to understand.
It would have been important for Parliament, which accepted the reduction of dioxin emissions into the air and the reduction of the values, to also agree to the values for water.
It is quite incomprehensible why the values accepted for dioxin in water are five times as high as those for the air.
After all, water is the most essential means of survival and it is not impossible for drainage water to enter the ground water and for the emissions in the air to precipitate into the water.
That is why I very much regret that Parliament did not agree to halve the emissions of hazardous substances into the water or even opt for a zero emission level.
We had suggested a late date, namely the year 2020.
This would have been feasible in technical terms.
Unfortunately we did not manage to give priority to consumer protection.
