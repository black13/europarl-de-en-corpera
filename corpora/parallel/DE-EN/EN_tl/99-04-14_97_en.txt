Mr President, I just wanted to say that I respect Mr Lambrias's opinion.
But he did not express the opinion of the Group of the European People's Party.
I expressed it this morning in the presence of the President-in-Office of the Council.
Applause
I want to make that clear.
And it must be recorded in the Minutes!
