Mr President, with the Valverde LÃ³pez report on the Commission proposal, Parliament is essentially aiming for a more practicable eco-management and audit scheme.
Many of the amendments are designed to improve the scheme.
There are, however, nine amendments which run directly counter to this aim, and they have been endorsed by a majority of this Parliament.
It was because of those amendments that I and the other members of the Bavarian Christian Social Union, as well as a number of other Members, did not vote for the report.
I merely wanted to put that on record.
