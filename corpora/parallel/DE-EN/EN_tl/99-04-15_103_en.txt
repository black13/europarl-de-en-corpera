Mr President, there are many extremely good points in this resolution.
Nevertheless, I abstained because of the adoption of the Greens' amendment which sought to tie us down to a solution whereby Kosovo would be autonomous within the Yugoslav borders.
Several weeks and months ago, such formulas could certainly have provided a basis for discussion.
But they have now been overtaken by developments.
Unless the Milosevic regime is removed, such a solution can never be an option.
And even if it were removed, the prospects for such a solution would still be slim.
It is impossible to force people to live in the same place, in the same state, as the murderers of their families.
That is why I believe that this approach is totally divorced from reality.
We should not have committed ourselves to a specific solution.
What is good is that the House has unreservedly supported the military action by NATO, which is necessary, appropriate and justified, as well as the aim of bolstering Serbia's neighbours.
One thing, however, seems to be missing from the resolution: it is high time we also sent a strong signal to Croatia, which is a major stabilising factor in the region but has been the victim of what amounts to blinkered disregard on our part.
I earnestly appeal for the conclusion of a trade and cooperation agreement with Croatia.
