Mr President, as in recent motions for resolutions and debates, all we can do again this time is to condemn once again the continued violations of the human rights of various sections of the population in Burma.
All we can really do is repeat ourselves.
Regrettably, an already grim situation has been made even worse by the sad news of the death of Dr Michael Aris, the husband of Aung San Suu Kyi.
The couple were forced to live apart, because she was unable to visit him and he was not permitted to visit her.
I believe their private grief is a microcosmic illustration of the repression and cruelty practised by the Burmese regime.
We must encourage the Commission to use its influence, particularly with Burma's neighbours, to isolate Burma with a view to securing the resignation of the present government and halting the maltreatment of villagers, who are taken away for forced labour or whose entire villages are resettled.
We must encourage and exhort the Council to discontinue any cooperation with the ASEAN states in which Burma is involved, not to integrate Burma into any cooperative ventures in the region and to prevail upon Germany, as the holder of the Council presidency, not to issue any entry visas.
We have imposed a ban here, and all the Member States of the Union should enforce it.
