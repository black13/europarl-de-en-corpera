Mr President, the previous speakers have already dealt in sufficient detail with the entirely unacceptable circumstances surrounding the refusal of the Burmese Government to let Dr Michael Aris enter the country before he died, and they have also spoken about China's support for that barbaric regime.
For this reason, I should like to focus your attention more sharply on the ethnic cleansing that is taking place in Burma.
The fact that we have adopted a resolution on Kosovo this very day lends special significance to this point, in my opinion.
In our resolution we are especially critical of conditions in the Karen villages this time.
But at the same time we must not overlook the fact that this is all part of a larger plan, as Amnesty International, for example, exposed very graphically in London last year.
We showed how, in the previous two years, some 300 000 members of the Shan people had been forcibly resettled and how the Mon, Akha and Lahu peoples were being driven out into neighbouring countries.
In the light of this fact, it is only right and proper for us to rethink our policy on visas, as proposed in paragraph 9, and to ban Burma from attending EU-ASEAN and ASEM meetings until genuine improvements are observed in the human rights situation.
