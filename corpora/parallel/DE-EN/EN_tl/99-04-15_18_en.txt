Mr President, the Quaestors have informed Members that we shall be in our offices for the last time in May before the removal takes place.
Now I have just discovered this morning that groups of visitors are already being shown round the new buildings.
As a Member of Parliament, I must say that I have the distinct feeling that we have been left in the dark here, because we have had no opportunity for a preview of the new buildings, let alone examples of our offices.
I regard that as a great mistake, and I ask that we find a means of rectifying that situation as quickly as possible.
