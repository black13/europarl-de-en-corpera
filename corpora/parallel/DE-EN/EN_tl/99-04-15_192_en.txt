Mr President, this Parliament, like all democratic institutions, must send out a signal and a warning to the international community that violations of human rights are unacceptable and that history does not forget them.
The massacre in Cambodia must not be consigned to history, and its perpetrators must be called to account.
That is why it is right to set up an international ad hoc tribunal here.
It is right because Cambodia itself is apparently unable to set up a tribunal, since the Cambodian State does not possess the necessary structures.
The establishment of a framework of civil law is a challenge to the Commission to show how it can help.
We have issued that challenge on several occasions, and I believe Europe has a considerable amount of assistance to lend.
That also applies in the context of our work with all the nations of ASEAN.
It also applies to Malaysia.
The previous speaker dealt in some detail with the case of Anwar Ibrahim.
We cannot tolerate unlawful detention in that case either, and we call on the Commission and the Council to make the appropriate approaches in Malaysia.
Otherwise we should have to take measures to freeze our diplomatic relations.
