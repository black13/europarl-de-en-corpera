Mr Chairman, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of my group, and in particular of my two Irish party colleagues, I wish to express our twofold sense of shock.
First of all we are shocked by the cold-blooded murder of a woman who was personally and professionally devoted to the defence of human rights, and secondly we are shocked by the fact that particular elements, not in a distant part of the world but in the heart of a country of the European Union, are using terrorist violence to undermine an emergent peace process.
But our task here is not only to express our shock but also to state our unequivocal demands.
Firstly, we demand an enquiry by the prosecuting authorities into the background to this murder.
In addition, like those who have spoken before me, I call for an international enquiry by the competent staff of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.
