Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted against the Thyssen report, because it is detrimental in many respects to certain business sectors and of course to people starting up in business.
Examples of these disadvantages are that an agreement with a brewery could no longer consist of the brewery financing the establishment of a restaurant or public house, subject to the proprietor signing a ten-year supply contract.
This, I believe, is a blow to people starting up in the licensed trade and to the trade itself, because these supply arrangements have been standard practice and have served as a stepping-stone to success.
The same applies to the oil industry, which builds service stations and at the same time concludes supply agreements with the service station operators for ten years or more.
On the basis of this report, all such arrangements will become more difficult or impossible in future.
That is why I voted against it.
I believe it is inconsistent with our aim of promoting business start-ups and the creation of jobs.
