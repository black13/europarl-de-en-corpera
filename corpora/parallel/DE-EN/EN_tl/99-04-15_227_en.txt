Mr President, I was basically happy to accept everything in the report, along with the amendments.
However, I should like to comment on one point which goes somewhat beyond the Hungarian question.
When we talk to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, we are all too inclined to assume a schoolmasterly pose and lecture them about things that we should do better to put right in our own backyard.
It is exceedingly hypocritical of us to reproach them continually about corruption, for example, when our own Community is notoriously plagued by recurrent widespread corruption on a grand scale.
These countries undoubtedly have serious problems, since they have emerged, after all, from foreign occupation and dictatorship, which has invariably led to a certain breakdown of a nation's moral fibre; under these circumstances, I believe it is absolutely hypocritical of us to wag our finger at them.
All I wished to say was that I have voted in favour, because I am keen to see these countries' early accession to the Union.
The point I have made is for future reference, so to speak.
