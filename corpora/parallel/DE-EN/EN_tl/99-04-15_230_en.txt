Mr President, I gladly voted for Mr Carnero Gonz√°lez's report.
One reason is that he himself has adopted a very sound approach, focusing very sharply on the rule of law, the legal system and minority questions.
But I am also very pleased about the adoption of Amendment No 8 - the Nassauer and Poettering amendment - in which the European Parliament calls unequivocally for the repeal of the so-called Benes Decrees.
I have no doubt that we want to forge ahead with enlargement.
But if we wish to extend our legal community, we must insist emphatically on the preservation of its character as a community in which the rule of law prevails.
When unlawful decrees are brought into such a community, it is like introducing a virus into a computer system.
It endangers the whole system.
That is why unlawful decrees must be repealed prior to accession.
We have taken a major step in that direction today.
