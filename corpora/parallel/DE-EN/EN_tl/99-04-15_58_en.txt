Mr President, in this list that we have here, some committees are not included, although we know that they all have to do with the budget.
What we are essentially proposing is that no selection of committees should take place and that instead, with your permission and the cooperation of the House, we could perhaps move an oral amendment to include all committees that have anything to do with the budget.
I believe this would be only fair to the committees that are not listed here.
Can we agree on that?
