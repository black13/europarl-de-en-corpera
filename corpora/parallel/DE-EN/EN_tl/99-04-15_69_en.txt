Mr President, Mrs Hautala, who chairs the Committee on Women's Rights, was trying to move an oral amendment to Amendments Nos 1 and 2 in order to specify which forms of sex discrimination fell within the remit of committees I and VIII.
It goes without saying that these committees cannot be responsible for those forms of discrimination that are a matter for the Committee on Women's Rights.
Unfortunately, a number of colleagues have intervened to prevent the adoption of this reasonable motion.
I believe that my honourable colleagues were unable to grasp what was at stake here.

You did not see me, although I was asking to speak in order to make that clear to you before you all took the floor.
Since we are now voting about the Committee on Women's Rights, let me spell out that Amendments Nos 1 and 2, which relate to the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs and to the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, naturally cannot and do not in any way imply that these committees should be responsible for the forms of sex discrimination that fall within the remit of the Committee on Women's Rights.
