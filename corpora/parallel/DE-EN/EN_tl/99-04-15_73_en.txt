Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is not a question of whether we are in favour of social cohesion.
We are all in favour of social cohesion.
It is a matter of the Rules of Procedure and what they prescribe.
We have just unanimously adopted the catalogue of responsibilities: number one is transport, and number two is regional policy.
It makes no sense to reverse that decision ten minutes after taking it.
What is even more important is the fact that the wise ladies and gentlemen of this House have justified the amalgamation of the committees by saying that no major legislation would be necessary in the field of regional policy for the next two years.
All of this substantiates the case for leaving things in the proposed order: transport, regional policy and tourism.
Applause
