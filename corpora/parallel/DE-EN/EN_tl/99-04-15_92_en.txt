Mr President, I should very much like to support paragraph 5 with a view to protecting the refugees.
But may I ask the groups that have tabled this motion to explain what can be done to ensure that the creation of militarily protected humanitarian corridors to Albania and Macedonia does not usher in the partition of Kosovo.
That is the problem I have with paragraph 5.
