Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is not a further oral amendment but was agreed during the coordinators' negotiations.
It relates to no less a person than Dr Ibrahim Rugova, who holds the Sakharov Prize of the European Parliament.
That must be added.
We really did forget that.
It is not an oral amendment that we are free to reject, but was actually agreed by all those who were present.
