Mr President, I believe our honourable colleague Mrs Oomen-Ruijten is mistaken this time.
Although she rightly reports that our group adopted an amendment, I must point out that the same amendment was rejected here in the Chamber yesterday.
This means that the President's interpretation is correct.
