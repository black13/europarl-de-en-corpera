Mr President, I did try to raise this earlier on the Minutes, but my request was apparently not spotted.
I only wish to draw attention to the two amendments tabled by our group on the question of carry-overs, where the texts are incompatible in their present form.
They were rejected.
These amendments are based on the current Rules of Procedure, and we have now adopted a resolution that is at odds with the existing Rules of Procedure, according to which the Committee on Budgets is responsible for transfers of appropriations from the reserve, while all other carry-overs - and I am generalising somewhat here - are the responsibility of the Committee on Budgetary Control.
May I ask you to check that, because we undoubtedly have a contradiction here.
That is why I tabled these amendments on behalf of my group.
I cannot tell you the numbers of the two amendments offhand, but that can easily be checked.
