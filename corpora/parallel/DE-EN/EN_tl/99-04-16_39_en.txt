Mr President, let me begin by thanking the two rapporteurs for this excellent and very comprehensive report.
I shall not spend any time enumerating the really good initiatives and options it contains, because we can all read that for ourselves.
The title 'Senior citizens in the 21st century' strikes me as being very ambitious as well as presenting an obligation.
It challenges us in Parliament, along with the Commission and the Council, to develop a far-sighted policy for the over-60s in the European Union, of whom there are already 75 million.
Most people over the age of 60 are in full possession of their mental and physical powers.
I would go along with Mr Schiedermeier and Mr McMahon on that.
There is still a huge amount of discrimination everywhere, and I believe these people have no desire to be treated as basket cases; all they rightly ask of policymakers and society is a level playing field and a social safety net.
Now that we have the Treaty of Amsterdam and its Article 13 on the suppression of discrimination, including age discrimination, we have a legal basis for common European action.
We did adopt a senior citizens' programme a few years ago, but it was blocked in the Council by the Conservative Governments of Britain and Germany on the flimsy grounds that there was no reliable legal basis and that it was ultimately a matter for national governments to pursue such a policy.
But this meant that there was no accompanying activity of any description at European level, and that the information links which were already established between senior citizens' organisations in the European Union were no longer financed, which resulted in some of them fading into oblivion.
We could truly have made more progress by now, and I hope that we shall advance in future on the basis of this report.
My wish for all the people of Europe is that both the senior and the junior citizens of the Union will be able to live together in solidarity.
