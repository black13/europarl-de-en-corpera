Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Staudinger, one of our mayors from Upper Austria, once made a remark to the effect that senior citizens are an important political factor with a bright future.
I believe that sums up this issue very neatly.
One in four of the European population is directly involved, and it is our concern to focus on the self-esteem of this section of the population, so that they can assume their role and their responsibility in society as we would wish them to do.
When it comes to the working world, I believe we must ensure that we find models of best practice, that we ask ourselves how we can help to integrate older people into the labour force and help them to feel comfortable in their working environment.
There are many models in Europe that are worth considering.
We also favour flexible working hours to take account of the needs of older employees in particular.
We in Parliament have been staunch advocates of the European Bus and have expressed the view that getting on and off public transport must be made easier, or indeed possible, for elderly people.
Too little attention is paid to that, and we shall press hard for this demand from Parliament to be met.
One of our aims in the field of research policy is to ensure that increased biotechnological research is conducted with a view to improving the health of all people, including the very elderly.
The European Parliament has managed to ensure that an extra billion euros will henceforth be earmarked for research.
I believe that is something to be proud of, something that will benefit our older citizens too.
