Mr President, we voted yesterday on my report concerning the Commission White Paper on infrastructure charges.
I see that the parliamentary services, probably for stylistic reasons, have changed the text on which we voted in paragraph 1.
In my report, which was adopted by the committee without any amendment to paragraph 1, I called for the introduction of a uniform charging system for all modes of transport, 'based inter alia on marginal social cost'.
The wording represented a deliberate attempt to keep open the option of incorporating other factors.
Now some language freak has changed this into 'on the basis of marginal social cost', which conveys an entirely different message.
I must insist that the original wording be put back into the report, both in the German version and in any translations that have been altered.
