Mr President, I realise that our rapporteur, Mr Wynn, was not here to present the reports on the discharge for 1996 and 1997.
The reports were adopted in committee without any amendments.
They were finalised in committee and can therefore also be put on the agenda for tomorrow's vote.
I should like to mention this here for the sake of the procedure, because an opinion was delivered on the subject by Mrs GÃ¼nther which likewise dealt with the development budget for 1996 and 1997.
According to the procedure, we therefore ought to include this on the voting list for tomorrow.
I should like to ask you to see to this, because as I have said, the rapporteur was not present.
