Mr President, I am sorry I am late, but there are other meetings taking place at the same time and it simply is not possible to be in two places at once!
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, throughout the debate about reforming the Commission, I have supported clear principles, and today these same principles once again form the basis of the amendments I have tabled to the Elles, Brinkhorst and Fabra Vall√©s reports.
Firstly, responsibility must be seen to be accepted.
That is why the accounts for the 1996 financial year cannot be closed straight away, for example while there has been no reimbursement in areas where nepotism has been established.
Secondly, the greater the transparency, the less need there is for controls.
As long as the Commission still does not respect Parliament's right to have access to information, the institutions cannot trust each other, and nor will they win the increased trust of the general public.
That also applies to a Commission which has resigned.
Thirdly, Parliament's criticism of the Commission will only be credible in the eyes of the general public if it adopts the same critical attitude towards itself.
As long as documents in connection with proceedings against SEL are withheld from me and the Committee on Budgetary Control, discharge should not be granted for Parliament either.
I hope I have made it clear that where discharge is concerned, my group is guided by its own principles, which indeed apply to both the Commission and Parliament.
