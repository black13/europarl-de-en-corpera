Madam President, when the most elementary rules of logic are disregarded in politics, it is rarely out of ignorance of these rules but because there is some interest in doing so.
That is why the question I am asking myself today is this: why was it in Parliament's interests to block its own supervisory powers?
Might it not be the case that in the past - and I hope only in the past - it was more in the interests of the large groups in this House to protect the Commission than to call it to account and strengthen their own Parliament?
According to the Treaties, Parliament takes the decision on discharge by a simple majority.
However, Parliament divided this decision into two procedures.
Accordingly, the vote to grant discharge was by a simple majority, but the vote to refuse discharge was by an absolute majority.
Hence the comical and completely absurd situation of a majority of this Parliament not voting in favour of granting discharge to the Commission, and the same Commission still not being refused discharge.
This is an absolutely ridiculous state of affairs, which I can only put down to huge self-interest, and I hope that the large coalitions which put protecting the Commission before Parliament's right of control have learnt from the events of the past months and will be more loyal to Parliament than their Commissioners in the future.
