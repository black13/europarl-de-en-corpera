Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a sound economic policy, which gives companies breathing space, is the best way to create more jobs.
Last year it was possible to bring unemployment down to 10 %.
This pleasing, though by no means adequate trend cannot, however, as claimed in many quarters, be attributed to the employment policy measures taken by the Union.
The realisation that the efforts made by the Union hitherto, including the NAPs, have been insufficient and have had little success is another reason why this Employment Pact is necessary.
If we wish to take a positive view of these reports, then we can say that we have recognised the problems and have ideas about how to tackle them.
But ideas and an awareness of the problem alone will not create a single job.
The will and the ideas are there, but there is a big gap when it comes to implementing the measures.
There are only limited ways in which the Union itself can create jobs.
This is the task of the nation states and companies, in particular the SMEs on which we must focus all our attention.
Creating one new job costs around ATS 1 million in my national currency.
Since 1989, therefore, the appropriations in the Structural Funds alone could have created six million jobs!
But these jobs are nowhere to be seen, declared the President of the Court of Auditors, Mr Friedmann.
