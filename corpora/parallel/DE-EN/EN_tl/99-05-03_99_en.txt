Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, although the Committee on Development and Cooperation has to grant discharge for the European Development Fund each year, it does not have any influence on how this fund is used because it has not so far been integrated into the budget.
Governments have repeatedly signalled, before taking up the Council presidency, that they might be able to support integrating it into the budget.
Later, however, numerous reasons have been found for postponing this decision after all.
One of the committee's specific criticisms of the 1997 budget is that large amounts are transferred from one Development Fund to the next.
The suggestion is therefore being made to simplify the management of appropriations.
With regard to the appropriations for cofinancing, the committee also criticises the fact that individual projects take too long to complete and that the supply of funds in particular often causes huge problems for the non-governmental organisations.
The Court of Auditors and the Development Committee are waiting rather anxiously to see whether the new structures which the Commission is now introducing will prove to be effective here.
That is why the Committee on Development and Cooperation requests that a report should be submitted to it next March on experiences with the new structures.
The committee also takes the view that the response to the procedural shortcomings criticised by the Court of Auditors should be for a minimum degree of competition to be required, in particular in the tendering and award procedures.
Nevertheless, the committee agrees with granting discharge for the 1997 Development Fund.
Development cooperation is not one of the areas which voters immediately see as an essential part of European policy.
We are therefore all the more dependent on financial resources being used transparently and in a way which people can understand.
