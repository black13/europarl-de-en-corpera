Mr President, I would like particularly to express my warmest thanks to Mr Fischer for his clear words and his clear stance in what is a very difficult situation.
I should like to look in greater detail at two points which unfortunately were not given much attention in the discussion but are in my view essential.
We are constantly talking about having to send ground troops into Kosovo.
This is a reasonable idea in itself, but it is not appropriate for this region.
We already know from experience - and I am perhaps old enough to have been involved in these experiences - that foreign troops simply do not succeed.
On the other hand, I have witnessed the liberation of Krajina in Croatia, for example.
There the Croats had weapons and were able to sweep the Serbs aside immediately.
It has been proved again and again that people who are defending their own land are superior to the aggressors.
We must recognise this.
There is the KLA, there are the Albanian forces, and we must give them weapons so that they can meet the mobs coming out of Serbia on an equal footing.
We will be astonished at how quickly the ground fighting will come to an end.
The second point is that at the beginning we made a huge psychological error by repeatedly saying that the Kosovars must remain with Serbia, must remain in Yugoslavia.
Ladies and gentlemen, we keep forgetting the fact that the state is there for the people, the people are not there for the state.
So the people should have the right to self-determination, and we should grant this right to the inhabitants of Kosovo, who for decades have undergone indescribable suffering at the hands of the Serbian Government in Belgrade.
Milosevic is only the product of an old policy that goes back to before the Second World War.
