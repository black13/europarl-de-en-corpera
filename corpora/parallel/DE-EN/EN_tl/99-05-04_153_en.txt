Mr President, it is highly significant that the whole foreign policy discussion has centred around Russia.
Russia is indeed the most important problem in our foreign policy.
But this has been the case for a long time in our history.
Unfortunately, I sometimes have the impression that many of our leading politicians who talk about this have not read history or, if they have read it, have not understood it.
We need a realistic relationship with Russia that should not be determined by fear but a policy that knows what the facts are and takes them on board.
Enrico Berlinguer once made a very true comment, which was that we should take what the Russians tell us seriously.
We do not take it seriously.
We have not taken on board that this is an imperialistic power with whom we have to coexist, but we must recognise that it is an imperialistic power and that attempts to make the poacher turn gamekeeper, as it were, sometimes go astray.
We must pursue a realistic policy that is based to a large extent on the fact that Russia today, at a time of worldwide decolonisation, is the last great colonial empire on earth.
Russia will join Europe one day, but I am convinced that this will only be possible when it has been decolonised, since we do not want to be dragged into any new colonial wars with the countries of the Far East, which is a very real danger.
Anyone who has dealt with China - and I would hope that our politicians will devote more attention to China - knows what its plans are.
China is a power that also has commitments in Siberia; every day 5 000 Chinese cross the Amur border illegally.
These are the things we need to think about.
I am grateful to Mr Spencer for his report; I would only ask that we keep to the situation in reality.
