Mr President, I am speaking on my own behalf, like Mr Medina Ortega, as we will not form a group opinion until this evening.
I do not wish to dwell on details as we will discuss these in any case in due course.
Today we are concerned with the fundamental issues.
We are concerned with the European Parliament and the self-image of the only legitimate, freely and directly elected body of the European Union.
The Members of this Parliament are subject only to their consciences and to the will of the people of Europe.
We do not need anyone to tell us what to do, not a group chairman, nor a Conference of Presidents, and certainly not the Council.
The people of Europe are concerned with much more urgent problems than a statute for MEPs.
If we are to be able to solve the really significant problems as a Parliament we must not allow ourselves to become puppets on such a minor issue as this Statute.
This is exactly what the Council is trying to do.
It is simply not fulfilling its Treaty obligations and is ignoring the decision approved by Parliament on 3 December 1998 by an overwhelming majority.
Instead of this we are being given a mass of detailed rules that are incomplete, inconsistent, amateurish and highly dangerous for democracy.
I have to say that I am extremely concerned about this.
We must not allowed ourselves to be restricted by financial dependency or to be given a binding mandate.
If we do not succeed in safeguarding individual MEPs' freedom of decision we cannot claim to be able to accomplish anything for the people of Europe.
So let us continue along the right path that has been outlined for us by our rapporteur Willy Rothley, a path which Parliament has already agreed on.
It is only by doing this that we can retain our standing with the electorate and continue to hope for their trust.
