Madam President, I would like to ask for your help.
I can see nobody at all here from Parliament's administration, and Mr Wynn and Mr Samland are already all too familiar with what I have to say.
In view of this, I am really not prepared to speak here.
Perhaps you could advise me what to do.
I could hand in my speech in writing, and then we would save five minutes and you could move straight on.
But I do not think this is the right way to proceed.
Of course everyone is in group meetings discussing the Statute, and that is where I should be now too.
So please tell me what I should do.
However, I feel that it would be beneath my dignity - and this is of course not intended as a criticism of those who are present - to complete the procedure in this way.
