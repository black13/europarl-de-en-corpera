Madam President, I rise to make just one point, but an important one.
It relates to an issue that the Commissioner touched upon rather tangentially.
I have in mind the issue of adjusting expenditure in line with a decision that may be taken this week.
If we accept the interinstitutional agreement on Thursday, Parliament is then free on the basis of that agreement to implement appropriations from Category 1 to Category 4 at first reading.
However, we cannot do this for Category 5, where we need a letter of amendment from the Commission.
As I indicated during the discussion with Mr Prodi this afternoon, the present timetable Parliament has set for appointing the new Commission, which involves the Commission being appointed by the earliest in mid-September, means that there are only two weeks left to submit this letter of amendment.
Whatever happens, we ought to have it before the European Parliament's first reading, as otherwise we will be at the mercy of the Council when it comes to making additional appropriations available in Category 5, because if the letter is not submitted until after Parliament's first reading, an amendment will only be permissible if both parts of the budget authority, that is the Council and the Parliament, agree to it.
I would therefore ask the Commissioner and the officials responsible for this to start work on the preparatory process now.
Mr Prodi also gave an undertaking to this effect in the meeting with the committee chairman, so that an appropriate letter of amendment can be presented within this time frame, allowing Parliament to take it at first reading.
