Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, my dear Neil, it is a great honour for me, as we reach the conclusion of the transport debates over recent years, once again to express my group's appreciation for the excellent cooperation we have achieved.
We may have different political views, but we have always had trust in each other.
I believe that it is important for there to be trust between the institutions and for each to recognise the competence of the others.
We have always done that.
I would therefore like to thank you once again, and to say farewell, whatever office you may hold next time.
