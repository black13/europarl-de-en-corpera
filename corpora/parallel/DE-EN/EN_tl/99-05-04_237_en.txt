Mr President, we shall also be giving our assent tomorrow.
I was very pleased that Mrs Sandb√¶k also reiterated that it was the amendment tabled by the Greens which provided that baby foods should in future be pesticide-free.
I think that this is a great victory for consumer protection, and it contributes in a significant way to making agricultural policy more environmentally friendly.
We have proved with this decision that we can succeed in making the highest standards, namely the no-trace limit value already in force in Germany - a standard for the whole of the EU.
We can now only hope that the manufacturers of baby foods in the EU make the necessary adjustments quickly, since it is clear that baby foods must be free of all poisonous substances.
Harmonisation in this area really cannot be reduced to the lowest common denominator; instead, we must demonstrate the highest degree of precaution and duty of care towards the youngest members of our society.
However, we hope that this will now also be the starting point for an initiative against the ADI concept for all foodstuffs, particularly those for school children and young people, since it in fact refers to the recommended intake of pesticides for an adult.
It is not only babies who absorb on average much more per kilo of body weight, but also school children and young people.
I now think that we must start to reconsider the whole ADI concept, and we must build on this success in an attempt to extend it in future to school children and young people, since it has been proven that even the minutest quantities of pesticide can result in serious illness, particularly among children.
