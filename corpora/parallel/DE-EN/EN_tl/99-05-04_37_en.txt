Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Prodi, yours is a difficult task, but at the same time you have it easy: it is difficult because of the challenges with which the European Union will be faced in the next five years, and easy because Parliament, the Council and the European public have never before shown such strong support for a new beginning in the Commission.
You want to bring the administration under political control, and you have our support for this.
But please let your administration know that the balance has shifted between Parliament and the administration in Brussels, and that the administration must act accordingly in future.
In the eyes of the European public the new Commission will be a European government.
Perhaps the Treaty does not quite say so, but you need to want to be a sort of European government.
In your statement you mentioned almost all the key words for the next five years: agriculture and towns, competition and social affairs, youth, the elderly, public limited companies, small and medium-sized enterprises, consumer protection and liberalisation, enlargement and relations with the USA.
However, Mr Prodi, I would have liked to see rather less pointillism and rather more constructivism in the picture you painted of the new Commission's work.
Finally, Mr Prodi, in tomorrow's vote we shall be endorsing both yourself as an individual and your political work to date.
This will strengthen your future political authority.
We expect you to use this political authority in forming the new Commission and in your political leadership of the new Commission over the next five years.
Tomorrow you will be given a preliminary vote of confidence - including from my group - but you should not be under the impression that you can rely on this confidence for five years.
You will have to build this trust yourself through your work.
We are prepared to help you because we believe it will serve Europe.
We wish you every success.
