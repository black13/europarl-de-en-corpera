Mr President, every decade has its visions.
In the 1980s Europe's vision was the completion of the internal market, in the 1990s it is monetary union.
The forthcoming phase must be geared towards consolidation and improving and strengthening what has been achieved; it must be a period of root and branch and reform, as Tony Blair put it.
The root refers to the Commissioners; you are personally involved in their selection and in their quality and success, and you are responsible for them.
Renewing the structures, making the procedures more efficient and introducing transparent controls will be difficult enough.
The new Commission must be genuinely new in terms of people, thinking and action.
You and we owe this to the people of Europe.
The branches refer to the organisation as a whole.
It must be clear who is in charge of the administration.
The report by the Committee of Independent Experts should help you in this, and Parliament's assistance is assured.
It is not enough to try to make the overburdened bureaucracy more efficient.
New approaches are needed by increasingly involving the Member States; subsidiarity also relieves the burden on Brussels in implementing European tasks and increases everyone's sense of responsibility - a sense of responsibility that has hitherto not existed.
In your first statement you asked not to be judged on your past but on the visions and ideas that you bring to Europe.
We will hold you to that.
