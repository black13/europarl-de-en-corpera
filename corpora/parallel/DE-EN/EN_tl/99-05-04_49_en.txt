Mr President, Mr Prodi, you have been given an almost incredible amount of praise and recognition, and I am sure you not take it amiss if I introduce a negative note to this whole affair.
I will say first of all that the Austrian Social Democrats will also support you.
But I will say quite openly that this is not out of total conviction but on the basis of your achievements to date and as an initial vote of confidence.
It is obvious that you could not provide answers to several questions at this stage.
What bothers me a little - and this is the point I would like to focus on - is the fact that you placed too much emphasis on the market and too little on the social aspects.
As a tribute to our President, I would like to deal with this using Gramsci terminology.
Hegemony - in this case the hegemony of the market - disturbs me both as an economist and as a supporter of the market economy, as we in Europe have developed a model of the social market economy that is concerned particularly with reducing and preventing unemployment.
I admit, Mr Prodi, that you have stated clearly today for the first time, as far as I know, that you also want to combat and prevent the causes and sources of unemployment.
But that is still a little too weak for me - it still lacks substance.
I will say it clearly once again: we must strengthen market forces.
But we must also be aware that the market can only function in our model if there is as little unemployment as possible and as few social weaknesses as possible in our society, as otherwise the people of Europe will not come along with us.
In this respect I welcome you now as our new Commission President and hope that you will be able to restore this balance.
