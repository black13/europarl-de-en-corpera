Mr President, Item 18 of the Minutes - the debate on the European Fraud Investigation Office - is mentioned only very briefly; neither the Council president nor the Members who spoke are mentioned.
This is really not normal practice.
It only says that Members spoke, but it might be quite helpful if we knew who.
Perhaps this can be added.
