Mr President, I also have a point to make concerning the Minutes.
In Item 8 (Documents received), point (ab) mentions a draft decision by the European Parliament on the Members' Statute; it also gives a C-number.
I would like to ask what this actually refers to.
I do not remember this draft being presented yesterday.
Does it refer to Parliament's decision in December or does it refer to this Council paper that has no legal value?
I would like an answer here.
Applause
