Madam President, naturally we fought for the Kuhn report.
We would have liked to see the guarantee extended for up to five years; that would have meant that the principle of sustainability was finally also introduced de facto .
It would have meant that producers would have tried to produce long-life products.
What I very much regret about the compromise is the fact that when the directives are implemented it will now be possible for the Member States to introduce a two-month complaint period.
And I will be calling on the German Government not to make use of this; indeed it has already announced that.
It would be a bitter setback for consumer protection.
For how can it be that someone from France, for instance, goes shopping in Germany, relies on a two-year guarantee but then finds that because he bought the goods in Germany he should have lodged a complaint within two months?
I do not believe that is what we were aiming at with this report.
Indeed Mrs Kuhn is just as sorry about this provision.
Yet the report is a small step in the right direction.
I only hope that many Member States will not make use of the possibility that has now been established of a two-month complaint period.
If they do not, the report will be a step in the right direction because it will mean that consumers can have the guarantee extended to two years.
I believe it is very positive that we have also managed for the first time to establish a one-year guarantee for second-hand goods; that is a step towards greater sustainability and greater consumer protection.
However, I hope that also means that we do not apply this two-month complaint period, because in the case of many goods defects are only found after two months have elapsed.
Then consumers would get little out of this two-year guarantee.
So I can only appeal for this not to be applied.
