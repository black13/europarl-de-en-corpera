Here the Green Group is of course very pleased that we have now managed to make pesticide-free foods for babies and young children a binding requirement throughout the European Union.
That is not just a great success for consumer protection but also a major contribution towards a more ecological agricultural policy.
Of course it was also a major success on balance for our group, since the Greens' amendment was the only one to obtain an absolute majority and therefore led the Commission as also the Council to shift their position.
The decision to establish the precautionary principle here is groundbreaking and in our view it would now be sensible to extend it to cover schoolchildren and young people.
It also means that we have to radically rethink the concept of the average individual, for this principle is based on the assumption that harmful substances are measured against an average human being weighing 80 kg.
That certainly cannot protect the health of children, the frail and the old.
We are particularly glad that we have now managed for the first time to lay down the highest standard in the European Union in a binding way for all EU Member States, namely the zero detectability level, which de facto means organic farming, as laid down in Germany.
We have shown that we do not have to dumb down harmonisation to the lowest common denominator but that it is quite possible to set a binding highest standard for all the EU Member States.
We must take particular care of the youngest members of society.
Here we have managed to establish the precautionary principle and we hope this will prove possible in other areas too.
I see on my right my colleague Mrs Irene Soltwedel-Sch√§fer, who was visited on this very day by people affected by the BSE scandal.
I can only urge that if we make the precautionary principle a binding one - as we have managed here - we should also take it as our yardstick in many other areas.
