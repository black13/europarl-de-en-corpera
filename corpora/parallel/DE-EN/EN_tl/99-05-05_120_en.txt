Madam President, of course we too are pleased that the EU has spoken out quite clearly in favour of maintaining the ban on hormone-treated meat.
I personally find it most regrettable that the Commission commissioned this study so late.
We have known for years that there is at least one hormone that is suspected of being carcinogenic and that the other hormones have particularly adverse effects on young people during puberty.
We know, and that is the crucial point, that consumers do not want hormone-treated meat.
Consumers want healthy, natural food.
That is why this is a very positive decision, for it would have been a retrograde step to have simply introduced labelling, as we have sadly done in the case of novel foods even though the consumers have objected to genetically modified foods.
The Commission is also planning to extend the moratorium on genetically manufactured bovine growth hormones.
Here too it would be high time to issue a ban, as Canada has already done.
All the studies conducted by the Scientific Committee show the dangerous and explosive effects of treating animals with hormones.
There are many other indications to support these findings and we must also finally get away from the situation where the WTO only addresses the question of residues, for when they decide to buy goods, consumers also have the right to object to a certain kind of production.
So it is most welcome that the Commission has taken this decision; however, we should have already indicated the health hazards much more clearly and plainly in the past.
