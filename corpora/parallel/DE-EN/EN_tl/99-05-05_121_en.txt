Madam President, let me first say how happy I am to be able to give an explanation of vote during your last part-session as president.
I was most impressed by the strength of feeling Parliament has expressed towards you.
What also pleases me is the fact that this House has demanded unanimously by 525 votes - which is indeed rare - for the ban on hormone-treated meat to be maintained.
We in the Committee on Agriculture have succeeded in turning a proposal that tended towards giving preference to labelling into maintenance of the ban instead.
Now the scientific findings have confirmed our fears.
The outcome of the decision by 525 votes will impress the Council and make it now maintain this ban on hormone-treated meat and resume the discussions in the WTO panel, so as to make it clear that we are not in the mood to burden our people with this highly dangerous hormone-treated meat.
Many thanks and I wish you all the best!
