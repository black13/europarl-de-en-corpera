Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, once again I will have to represent our group because I am the only coordinator here present.
And I am happy to do so.
But let me say in advance that I come from Schleswig-Holstein and am also a Green, both of which make it difficult for me - unlike Mr Puerta who is so extremely good at it - to utter the usual words of praise.
It is not the custom where I come from, nor is it the custom in my party!
Mr President, I think I can assure you that we all have great respect for you.
We really have been most impressed by your composure, your ability to handle differences and opposed views, and I personally have learnt to value not just your sense of fairness but also your awareness of the growing tasks facing this House, for during this legislative term this House has grown at least a head taller.
And perhaps we have got over the problem of the short trousers - you know an incident occurred during the Conference of Presidents, at which I appeared in short trousers.
Everyone survived that with great composure too - after all, it was very hot!
Parliament really has gained in stature and weight now.
We have achieved that under your presidency, Mr Gil-Robles.
Heckling
I have not gained weight!
That is a misinterpretation.
Laughter
We have gained in political weight.
I do not think anyone here in the House can mistake that.
You, Mr President, have been active in your office and really stood up for the equal rights of all Members; you took active and successful steps to ensure that we now obtain a common European statute instead of a medley of national statutes.
One instead of 15, surely that is a qualitative step forward!
In that regard, and I do not think it is only my group that believes this, your term of office really was successful and you have done this Parliament great services.
Muchas gracias, Se√±or Presidente !
Applause
