Mr President, let me just say to the Commissioners here present that our joy at the conclusion of the trans-European networks and of the already concluded fifth framework programme of research is still slightly clouded.
I will add another drop of water so that you do not open the champagne too soon.
Both questions were explicitly tied to a new financial perspective.
If Parliament does not agree tomorrow to give its assent to a new interinstitutional agreement, then we will not have the financial framework which we have just discussed and on the basis of which the two agreements, on the fifth framework programme of research and on the trans-European networks, were concluded.
I just wanted to say this now, as a reservation, before the champagne starts to flow.
