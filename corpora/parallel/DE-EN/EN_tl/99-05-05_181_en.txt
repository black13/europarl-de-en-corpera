Mr President, let me answer this question as follows.
The Council expects Turkey, like any other contracting party, to fully and entirely fulfil the obligations arising from the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.
Furthermore, the Council is assuming that Turkey will respect the right of any person facing judicial proceedings in Turkey, which therefore includes Mr Ã–calan, to a fair trial and their right to defence, both of which are indeed also enshrined in the Turkish constitution.
In its statement of 22 February 1999, the European Union took note of the Turkish Government's assurances to that effect.
