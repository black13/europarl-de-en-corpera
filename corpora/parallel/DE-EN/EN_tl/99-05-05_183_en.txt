Mr Alavanos, I reject quite categorically your attack on the presidency.
You know the rules here.
What I have to present is the common position that 15 Member States have formulated on your question.
I cannot inform you of the German position as it is totally irrelevant.
It is not a question here of the presidency's view but of what the Council says.
That is what I have told you and I will repeat it: the Council expects and requires Turkey to comply with its national and international obligations, which arise from its own constitution and its accession to international conventions.
