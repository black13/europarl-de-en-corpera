Mr Dimitrakopoulos, it has been made clear to Turkey on many very recent occasions that its conduct in the Ã–calan case, namely the guarantee of a constitutional trial, will affect the development of relations between the European Union and Turkey.
If the Council concludes that Turkey is not fulfilling its obligations, it will take the appropriate steps.
I cannot predict them today.
But you can imagine what they would be.
