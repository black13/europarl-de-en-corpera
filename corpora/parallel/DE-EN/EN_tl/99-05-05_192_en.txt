Mrs Pailler, I am sorry to have to tell you that it is not within the Council's competence to judge how the Member States apply Community law; that is up to the Commission and the Member States concerned.
At the time of the incident you describe in your question, the Schengen acquis had not yet been integrated into the framework of the European Union.
Since it is a question here of relations between two Schengen partners, the admissibility of internal border controls comes under the Schengen implementing convention.
Article 2(2) of that agreement provides that internal border controls can be carried out for a limited period purely for the maintenance of law and order and the safeguarding of internal security.
The state that orders these controls decides whether this may apply here.
The entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty does not change this situation.
