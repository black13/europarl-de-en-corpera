Mrs Pailler, I have to tell you too that it is not a question of my personal view nor of the presidency's view.
I can only give you an answer agreed by the two states concerned, which you mention in your question.
Surely you can imagine the answer you would be given by the government concerned if you put the question to it in your national parliament.
I cannot go any further than that.
The Council is not competent in regard to your question.
The Commission is responsible for compliance with Community law.
I must ask you to put this question to the Commission.
As for the matter of principle addressed in your question, I can tell you that the Council is looking closely at the problem of how Europe can be brought closer to our people, how they can be made more aware of the advantages Europe offers them and also how we can increase these advantages, especially in the field of internal and judicial policy which we are just discussing.
Indeed we are already preparing a summit to be held in Finland in the autumn, which will be concerned with the further development of the People's Europe.
But let me say again: individual cases such as this one do not come within the Council's remit.
And the individual states would not tolerate any interference from the Council in the way they apply national or European law.
