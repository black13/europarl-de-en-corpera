Mr Ripa di Meana, I have to disappoint you too, however much you expect me as a politician to give a political answer.
You know the rules of Question Time.
I cannot give you a political answer off the cuff.
I will have to discuss it first with the French and Italian Governments and with all the other 13 governments.
After that you can have your political answer.
All I can do here is point out to you that the French Government is basing its decision on Article 2(2) of the Schengen implementing convention.
Naturally the French Republic, like any other member of Schengen, may carry out internal border controls for reasons of public law and order.
Whether or not that was justified in this particular case is something I as a politician have a very definite view on.
But I am not allowed to express it here.
