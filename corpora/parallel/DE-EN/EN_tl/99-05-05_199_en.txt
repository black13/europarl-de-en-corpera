Mrs Jensen, I am rather at a loss.
This was a supplementary to Mrs Pailler's question.
That question referred to the fact that on the evening of 26 March the French authorities refused 3 000 Italian nationals entry into France.
With the best will in the world I cannot see what bearing your question has on that incident.
But I am quite prepared to answer it in writing.
