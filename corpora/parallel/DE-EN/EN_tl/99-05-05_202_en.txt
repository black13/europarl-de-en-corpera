Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Minister, I sincerely thank you for this clear, detailed and satisfactory answer to my question.
It is a pleasure to see that this can sometimes happen during Question Time.
Let me specifically ask you to make every effort in this matter.
I receive a great many letters from Ukrainian pensioners who are in a really bad way and need help.
If at all possible, I would ask you, Minister, to take very energetic steps to help them.
After all they are our partners and will one day become our partners in the European Union.
I would be most grateful if you could repeat and emphasise this need again.
