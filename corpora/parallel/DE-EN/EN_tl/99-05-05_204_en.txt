Mr President, Mr von Habsburg, I take what you have just said not so much as a question but more as words of encouragement, which I am happy to accept.
I can assure you that we are keeping up constant pressure on Ukraine in relation to this matter.
One reason I was able to answer the question was that I know from my own practical political experience that there are cases, especially the cases I am sure you know too, where it is possible to get round this law and what that costs those concerned.
It really is hard to understand why someone who provides aid on an individual basis should incur costs that are many times higher than the value of the aid itself.
Here I agree entirely with you and we will keep up the pressure on Ukraine in this respect.
