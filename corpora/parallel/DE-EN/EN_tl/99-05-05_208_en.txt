Mr President, Mr Medina Ortega, it is with good reason that the rules of the European Union give the right of initiative to the Commission.
The Commission is not here at the moment, but it will certainly defend that right tooth and nail.
I would advise you to proceed as follows.
A government with a particular interest in this matter could easily urge the Commission to submit a proposal to the Council as soon as possible and then I could assure you that the Council would consider the matter without any delay.
