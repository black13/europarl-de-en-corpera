Mr Lindqvist, the Council attaches great importance to food safety, especially in relation to protecting the health of the consumer.
The Luxembourg European Council expressed this same concern in its statement on food safety.
In that statement it stresses that the production and marketing of safe food must be one of the European Union's priorities and that a high level of health protection must be ensured.
As I just said in reply to your Spanish colleague's question, it is up to the Commission to submit proposals to the Council for initiatives in this area.
For the rest let me say that if the Member States consider it necessary to maintain or introduce more stringent consumer protection measures than those that exist at Community level, they may do so pursuant to Article 129a of the EC Treaty - new Article 153 of the Amsterdam Treaty - provided such measures are compatible with the other provisions of this Treaty.
If a Member State takes further-reaching measures of this kind, it must notify the Commission thereof.
There are no further restrictions.
