Of course I can confirm that, Mr Lindqvist.
And I have already answered that question by pointing out that a Member State has the right to maintain or introduce more stringent consumer protection measures than those that exist at Community level.
Naturally that includes measures such as those you mentioned.
However, this must not create any barriers to trade or distortion of competition.
Hence the rule that the Commission must be notified of any such measures so that it can examine that question.
I am happy to read out the relevant passage from the Amsterdam Treaty again.
It is the fifth paragraph of Article 153, former Article 129a, and it reads: 'Measures adopted pursuant to paragraph 4 shall not prevent any Member State from maintaining or introducing more stringent protective measures.
Such measures must be compatible with this Treaty.
The Commission shall be notified of them.'
That is what I just explained to you.
Compatibility with the Treaty relates to the question of barriers to trade and freedom of competition.
