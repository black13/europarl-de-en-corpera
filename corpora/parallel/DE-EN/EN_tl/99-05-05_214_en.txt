Mrs Sandb√¶k, we have a problem here.
This is another question which seems out of context.
I was asked about food safety and I did not say a word about the six-month period you cite.
I know nothing about this six-month period; what I referred to was the Treaty provision on consumer protection.
Your question relates to an environmental matter.
That was not in the original question nor did I answer on the subject.
If you have a question on the subject, I am sorry to say we did not receive it so I can only answer it in writing.
