Mr Newens, first let me say that I hope this seemingly endless business is finally nearing its end now.
At its meeting of 26 April 1999 the General Affairs Council emphasised that the European Union intends fully to respect the latest WTO ruling in the banana dispute and to amend the EU banana regime accordingly and without further ado.
The Council therefore called on the Commission, in the light of further contacts with the USA and the other parties concerned, to submit proposals to amend the banana regime by the end of May 1999.
Since we are not yet at the end of May, I am not in a position to tell you what form these proposals will take.
