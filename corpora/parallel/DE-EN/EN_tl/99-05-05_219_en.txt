Mr Newens, with that question you have very accurately described the problem we are facing and that we have not managed to resolve so far.
On the one hand we want to protect the banana producers with whom we have very close links; on the other hand, however, we have to respect the WTO rules.
This dispute has now been going on for years and at some point one has to admit losing a dispute.
The European Union has lost.
It did not manage to win through here.
The costs are quite considerable in any case, if you think of the punitive tariffs that have been imposed.
Yet I am inclined to say that it is some satisfaction that the WTO has now markedly reduced the level of the punitive tariffs the USA may impose against the European Union.
We are now paying 191.4 million dollars instead of the 520 million dollars the USA had originally fixed by unilateral procedure.
We have to wait for the Commission proposal to see how the Commission manages to reconcile the two requirements you mentioned: protection of the producer, especially the poorer producer, and conformity with the WTO rules.
I really cannot predict that today.
