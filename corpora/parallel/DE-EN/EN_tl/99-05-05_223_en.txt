Mrs Karamanou, you are of course right to draw a parallel with the equally dreadful human rights situation in Kosovo, but in both cases we must after all look at cause and effect.
In the case of Iraq it is clear that the sanctions were imposed on the basis of UN Security Council decisions.
These sanctions were imposed because Iraq did not fulfil the necessary obligations for ensuring the security and stability of the region.
But the programme I have described was permitted and was set in motion to ensure that these sanctions do not have the effect you described.
I have also described the particular efforts being made by the European Union to ensure that this programme is effective.
If it is not effective in certain areas, particularly in the area of medical care, the responsibility lies entirely with the Iraqi Government which has acted out of what are truly contemptible and base motives.
Let me repeat: the Iraqi leadership wants to exploit this situation in order that the sanctions, which have a quite different political purpose, may be lifted.
We must call on Iraq to fulfil its responsibility towards its own people.
