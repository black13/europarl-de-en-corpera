Mr Newens, you are making a political statement here and all I can do is to respectfully take note of your opinion and to bring it up at the next Council meeting on the situation in Iraq.
I take a different view from you, but that is not the point here.
Your question made one point I want to address, the question of possible bureaucratic obstacles to implementing the humanitarian programme.
I agree: they did exist, which is why we have begun to streamline this programme, although this has not produced satisfactory results to date.
