Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, first of all I am glad that we obviously agree on the need to continue with the policy we have already begun vis-Ã -vis Algeria, regardless of what we think of what happened before the presidential election there.
By saying regardless I mean that we must endeavour to support a process of democratisation in Algeria and after all the preconditions there for the democratisation process are better than in many other countries suffering from a democratic deficit.
There are strong democratic forces in Algeria and there is also a very free press there, and one which indeed makes use of that freedom.
We must also say that up to the time when the six candidates withdrew, the electoral campaign had actually suggested that Algeria was moving towards democracy.
It was in fact the case that all the candidates could put forward their programme freely and without restraint and that the political debate in Algeria took place in the kind of constructive atmosphere not seen for a long time.
We also took particular note of the fact that one of the key issues of this Algerian electoral campaign was national reconciliation.
So we now conclude that in spite of the problem of which we are both aware, the movement towards a civil society in Algeria that began in the 1990s has in fact been boosted by the electoral campaign.
I therefore think that we should do all we can in the form of political dialogue and political contacts to give further support to that process.
In particular that means keeping in contact with the democratic forces in Algeria and supporting these forces, for instance by inviting them to the Member States of the European Union and to the European Parliament.
It is important to demonstrate international protection and international support for the democratic forces in Algeria.
