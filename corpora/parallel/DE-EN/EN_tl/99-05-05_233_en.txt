Mr President, Mrs Kjer Hansen, nothing is happening behind the scenes here; we are talking about an entirely open and public process.
The Treaty provides that the Schengen Secretariat will be integrated into the General Secretariat of the Council and that the Council will decide the detailed arrangements.
That is what the Council has done!
I have to say again that the political intention of the Treaty was to integrate the existing Schengen Secretariat - without any new appointments being made or any selection procedures being initiated - into the existing General Secretariat because surely there would be no point in the integration of one secretariat with another secretariat meaning that we appointed 80 new staff according to the rules that apply to the General Secretariat and kicked out the 80 people who used to work for the Schengen Secretariat.
I cannot imagine that the questioner would agree to such an inhuman and unsocial solution.
Nothing is being done behind the scenes here; it is a very normal, open procedure.
And I must say in all honesty that the Council cannot understand the resistance the General Secretariat staff is showing here.
