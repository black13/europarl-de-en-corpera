Mr President, I can only answer this question in the affirmative.
The Council received the Court of Auditors' report on the formation of joint enterprises in the fisheries sector on 9 December 1998.
The Council discussed the content of this report during the deliberations on the Commission proposal laying down detailed arrangements and conditions for Community structural assistance in the fisheries sector.
This Commission proposal contains various provisions aimed at removing the abuses listed in the Court of Auditors' report on the management of joint enterprises.
The presidency intends to take a final decision on this proposal at the Council of Fisheries Ministers in June, provided that Parliament has given its opinion by that date.
Looking at the agenda, it would seem that Parliament will be discussing that proposal this week.
