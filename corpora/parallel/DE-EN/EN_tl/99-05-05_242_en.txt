Mr Hyland, the aim of the proposal in the agriculture section of Agenda 2000 for a regulation on rural development is to regenerate the rural areas and simplify the agriculture rules.
The reform of the Structural Funds, which includes the agreed reduction of the number of Objectives from six to three, will make it easier to achieve this aim.
This has already been discussed in depth here today.
On that basis rural development policy can gradually establish itself as the second pillar of the common agricultural policy.
In that context, the Leader Community initiative will be continued in the form of Leader III.
Leader III aims to make rural development more dynamic overall by supporting the programme of innovative projects by local groups.
Overlaps between Leader and measures under the rural development regulation will be prevented by the fact that the rural development regulation concerns national or regional support measures, but not local measures.
Leader projects, by contrast, remain reserved to local action groups.
Let me also point out that this question is a subject of the debate we have interrupted with Question Time.
