Mr Collins, the Council shares your concern about the problem of the disappeared persons, including the prisoners of war, who fell victim to the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait.
At the 55th meeting of the Human Rights Commission in Geneva from 22 March to 30 April 1999, the European Union submitted a draft resolution calling on Iraq to cooperate with the appropriate international organisations and to provide information on the whereabouts or fate of the remaining disappeared persons.
We called for compensation to be paid to the families of those who have died in Iraqi prisons or have disappeared.
All Kuwaitis or other nationals who are still in prison must be released at once.
Families must be notified of the whereabouts of prisoners.
We also call on Iraq to provide information on death sentences carried out on prisoners of war or civilian prisoners, including the death certificates of prisoners of war or civilian prisoners who have died.
I do not think more can be done in this matter.
You know as well as I that unfortunately we are not in a position to force Iraq to comply with these demands.
