Mr Collins, I will not conceal from you that I am very pessimistic about this.
Efforts have been going on for a long time now and the European Union has stepped them up.
In my answer I did not even list all the initiatives we have already taken.
There are a number of others.
There is also a new initiative by the United Nations Security Council.
The situation remains unchanged and I cannot see what other means of pressure we can apply against a country on which we have already imposed the most far-reaching sanctions at our disposal.
