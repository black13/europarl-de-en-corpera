Mr President, Mr Gahrton, the Council is aware of the news agency report you quote.
Unfortunately that report about Council meetings and Swedish interpreters is undated and provides no further details.
Given the almost countless number of Council bodies that have met on such countless occasions recently, with the best will in the world the presidency has been unable to find out which Council meetings and which dates are being referred to.
So we have not been able to look into the actual incidents in question.
In regard to interpretation from Swedish in principle, let me say that a Council programme exists, and has also been forwarded to the Swedish Government, on the appointment and training of interpreters in the Swedish language and that this programme is now under way.
