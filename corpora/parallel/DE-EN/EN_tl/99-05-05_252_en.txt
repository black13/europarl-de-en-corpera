Mr President, Mr Gahrton, all I can tell you is that I myself have never attended a Council meeting at which Swedish was not interpreted from start to finish.
If you have information to the effect that this is not the case, I would be grateful if you could pass it on to me.
The presidency of the Council does not have such information and we did look into the press report you cite but were unable to find out when and where this is supposed to have happened.
Nor does the presidency have any kind of complaint before it from Sweden that its language is neglected at Council meetings.
May I perhaps advise you not necessarily to rely on an anonymous press agency report but to accept the official statement the Council presidency is giving you here.
So if you do have information, I would be grateful if you could pass it on and then we would look into the matter.
The principle of course applies that no Member State may be placed at a disadvantage by negotiations not being interpreted in its language.
