Mrs Hautala, you must have misunderstood me if you say my answer was diplomatic.
It was meant to be anything but diplomatic.
I wanted to make it clear that however noble and right a political concern may be, the Council cannot assume powers that it does not have.
The same applies to the presidency.
The situation is not what you think.
The presidency does not have the power to negotiate with the Member States about who they send to Brussels as a member of the Commission.
The President of the Commission whose appointment you confirmed today has that power, and that President of the Commission, who was also selected on the basis of whether he can effectively assert the rights that he has, is pursuing the aim to which you referred.
The presidency also has great sympathy for that aim, but unfortunately there is nothing at all it can do about it.
Since the office of presidency is filled by a country that can appoint two Commissioners, it can only ensure that the principle you called for is observed by its own country.
But unfortunately I have no means of doing the same for Sweden because Sweden only appoints one Commissioner, which means it is rather difficult to apply the quota system in this case.
