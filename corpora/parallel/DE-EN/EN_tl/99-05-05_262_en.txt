In reply to Mr Sj√∂stedt's question, let me emphasise that the internal organisation of the Commission is the affair of that institution alone.
As for the Council, it has never had call to act in the kind of situation addressed by the questioner.
On the contrary, in what are fortunately rare cases, the Council's administration has felt obliged to take strong action against officials who have not respected the necessary professional rules of conduct in the course of their duties.
