The Council cannot make any statement about the internal organisation of the Commission.
That is the Commission's own business.
The Council could give its view if this incident had concerned its own staff.
But that is not the case.
No such problem has arisen within the Council.
Nor can I make any judgment because obviously the personal files or disciplinary measures relating to Commission staff are not available to the Council.
It is quite impossible for me to judge what actually happened in this case.
You will have to address this question to the Commission.
And indeed you can easily do so.
The Council cannot make any comment.
