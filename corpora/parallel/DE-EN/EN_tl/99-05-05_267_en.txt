Thank you, Mr President-in-Office, for that very detailed and informative reply.
Yet I do have a supplementary.
You said that a decision was taken on 9 November during the bi-annual consideration of the question.
If my calculations are right, six months have elapsed since then but you said you could not foresee when the next six-monthly check would take place.
So I just wanted to ask: have I misunderstood something or has the timetable changed in some way?
I also wanted to ask another question.
Serious events have occurred since 9 November, namely the war in Kosovo, which after all has radically changed things.
I do agree that Croatia must fulfil certain conditions - and indeed it has already fulfilled many of them, while there are others that it has not - but I see no reason to place Croatia in a worse contractual position than, for instance, Albania or Macedonia, which are also politically very unstable and problematic countries, while Croatia is after all an emerging democracy.
That is my view but my actual question is this: when will the next decisions be taken?
