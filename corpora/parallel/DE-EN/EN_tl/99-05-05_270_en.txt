Mr President, we have had the same problem all evening.
I have totally different numbers from you.
That is what makes matters so difficult.
But I have now found the question, because Mr Brian Crowley's name is on it.
Mr Crowley, in reply to your question, let me refer you to the Council's common position as adopted on 14 April and forwarded to the European Parliament that same day.
In it, the Council stated that it was against earmarking a minimum amount of 1 % of ESF resources for fairly small subsidies to non-governmental organisations.
The Council regarded the Commission proposal to that effect as too inflexible and replaced the 1 % by what it referred to as an appropriate amount.
However, the Council intends to amend its common position and to provide for a possible 100 % cofinancing of these subsidies.
That would create an incentive for using European Social Fund appropriations for subsidies to non-governmental organisations.
