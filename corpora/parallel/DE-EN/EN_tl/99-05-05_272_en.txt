Mr Crowley, obviously I cannot give you that commitment.
And you know that, because it would mean suspending the existing Council decision.
I am quite prepared to put your arguments to the Council again and to reconsider them.
But let me tell you that I do not agree with your assessment of the matter.
I think the formula the Council has opted for tends to increase rather than reduce the possibilities of the funding you call for.
