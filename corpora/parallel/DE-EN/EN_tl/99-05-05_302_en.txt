Mr President, so as not to come under pressure of time, allow me to begin by doing something which I would not normally do until the end of my speech.
That is to say, I should like to sincerely thank Mrs Wulf-Mathies for her positive cooperation with the Committee on Regional Policy.
By now everything has already been said at least once in the House on the subject which we are dealing with today.
I would ask Mr Langen not to be tempted to heckle.
However, one point has not been made, a point that in my opinion should be made, namely that we should rediscover the market economy if we want the people and the new democracies of Central and Eastern Europe to one day fulfil the criteria for EU membership.
If we are really showing or want to show solidarity, then it is not sufficient to hand out money.
I know what I am talking about, since I come from a part of Germany which receives a considerable amount of funds from the European Union and western Germany.
However, this alone is not sufficient.
The principle of the market economy must be embraced wholeheartedly.
If we really want to show solidarity, we must help the people of Central and Eastern Europe to rediscover this instrument.
However, this means that we in the European Union first of all have to begin to actually embrace the market economy again ourselves.
I am sure that you will not mind if I do not quite use up all of my two minutes' speaking time.
