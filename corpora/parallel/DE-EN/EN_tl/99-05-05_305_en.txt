Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to depart from the subject of agriculture in order to discuss another important area with you, that of social policy.
At Parliament's first reading on the European Social Fund, I recognised that the orientation of the programme will have a great effect on the objectives and regions in question.
Nearly all the amendments we tabled have been included by the rapporteur.
The ESF is still basically orientated towards labour market policies, and the PPE has placed special emphasis on this.
Fund support only makes sense if the results of the projects are sustainable and they actually reach the target populations as well.
The PPE agrees with the common position on the ESF.
We would like to see the new ESF swiftly and smoothly implemented within the next year, without further loss of time and guaranteeing prompt and reliable planning for those responsible for the projects and for the Member States.
For this reason, we absolutely reject a third reading and will be voting against all the amendments which would result in this.
As shadow rapporteur, I would be able to support the amendments which have arisen as a compromise from the negotiations within the Council if the Council and the Commission confirmed that the amendments in question would in fact be adopted and the danger of a third reading therefore did not arise.
The people of Europe expect us to support development in their regions, and to do so by means of speedy and practical measures which are not bureaucratic.
We are placing a fund into the hands of the Member States in question, and they should not encumber or hinder it by laying down additional rules; instead, they can use it in a way which is genuinely in line with the objectives.
