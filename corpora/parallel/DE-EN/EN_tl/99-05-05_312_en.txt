Mr President, Commissioners, Mr President-in-Office, I should like to briefly refer to Mr Bar√≥n Crespo's report again and to point out that we are preparing ourselves for an enlargement which stands out due to the fact that we now have a number of countries requesting EU membership that we would not have thought possible ten years ago.
In the past, dictatorships were always given preferential treatment in terms of accession to the European Union if they were able to make their governmental structure a democratic one and found a way of doing this.
If this was the case in the past, then it should certainly remain so in the future.
Mr Hatzidakis pointed out in his speech that along with the transition countries of Central and Eastern Europe we also have an island in the Mediterranean.
He was talking about Cyprus, which is also thinking of joining the EU.
I should like to include a further Mediterranean island in the discussion, namely Malta.
Neither of these islands comes under the preparatory pre-accession measures which apply to the other countries.
However, like Cyprus, Malta is important geographically, and it has a stable democracy.
It is true that both countries have been granted an extension of one year for the fourth financial protocol, but the structures are not in place for a pre-accession phase.
If we are thinking of a kind of mini PHARE, then I would urge the Commission at some point in the near future to demonstrate to the applicant countries the perspectives under which they can approach their pre-accession phase, so that they obtain the same degree of specific planning criteria as the others, since those of us from the large EU Member States in particular should feel responsible for the small applicant countries.
