Mr President, forgive me for requesting to speak once again, but there has apparently been - or there may have been - a translation error.
I do not want the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights to be abolished; I was referring to the regulatory committee.
I think it is quite important to mention this, in case Mr Kinnock has been informed otherwise.
Apparently, it was translated differently in Italian.
So it is the regulatory committee that I should like to be abolished.
