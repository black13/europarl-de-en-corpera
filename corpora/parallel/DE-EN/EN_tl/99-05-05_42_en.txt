Mr President, NATO's war against Yugoslavia has failed in its declared objective.
It has not managed to put an end to the crimes against the people of Kosovo but instead has dramatically worsened their plight.
But this failed NATO objective, the humanitarian crisis, was the only justification for violating international law and conducting this war of aggression.
No end justifies the means.
That realisation is one of the foundations of our civilisation.
The ultima ratio has proved irrational.
All those who do not now restore the rule of law and end this war bear responsibility for the terrible violence, for the civilian victims, for the destruction of the basic means of livelihood and civilian infrastructure in Serbia, for the use of forbidden weapons.
