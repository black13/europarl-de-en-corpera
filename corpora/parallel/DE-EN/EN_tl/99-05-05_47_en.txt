Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, it is a very good thing that the German Presidency is to give the starting signal for another intergovernmental conference at the EU summit in Cologne.
We must make progress with the democratisation of the EU.
The core elements of this are as follows: majority voting as the rule, a new weighting of votes in the Council, structural changes in the Commission and the European Parliament's right of assent on all treaty changes.
The distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure could also be done away with.
But if our end is to be democratisation, it must also be the means.
That is why we have to apply the Community method to future reforms, which means that the Commission must make the first proposals; it is essential, I repeat essential, for the European Parliament to be distinctly more involved!
With the Amsterdam Treaty, Agenda 2000 and the euro, the EU has acquired a new quality; with the military operations in Kosovo its face has changed.
All this also brings us up against the question of the constitution we now have and the constitution that we need.
It is clear that however much we appreciate the presidents and grandees who presided over the beginning of European integration and the Community treaties, today we must give priority to basic rights and declare confidently that we, the citizens of Europe, are building a Europe of freedom, peace and solidarity.
Human dignity, justice and the social welfare state are both the means and the end.
The Biagio De Giovanni resolution sets out a guideline for the years to come.
The German Government deserves our support for its commitment.
