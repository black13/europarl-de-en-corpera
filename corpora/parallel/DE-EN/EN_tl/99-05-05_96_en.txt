Madam President, I wish to make a personal statement.
I voted against Mr Rothley's proposal because I am sorry we did not accept the Council document, which meant that we missed a major opportunity finally to obtain a statute at the end of this legislative term.
You all know how difficult it will be to make progress on a statute during the new term.
It will be wellnigh impossible.
I fear that Parliament's action has merely relegated the Statute to a kind of shunting yard.
I thought it was right for us finally to get some movement into the Statute, and the words 'equal pay for all' apply just as much to the Council; its members also do the same work but have different salaries.
There are hundreds of journalists who do the same work for different pay.
I regarded the compromise as viable even if - which is not, of course, a good thing - it would have meant that Swedish, Danish and British Members were taxed under their national rules.
But I got the impression that was not the issue at all; rather it was to go on relegating the Statute for Members to the shunting yard.
I very much regretted that.
That is why I voted against Mr Rothley's proposal and would have liked to vote for the Council proposal.
