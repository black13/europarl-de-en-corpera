Mr President, for two years we have been discussing this report in committee - yes, for two years!
We have presented more than twenty working papers on it.
At Monday's meeting of the Committee on Budgets we had another four-hour debate, in which Mr Fabre-Aubrespy chose not to participate.
Yesterday we discussed this report comprehensively here in Parliament.
So with all due respect, we can support the report or oppose it, but any move to refer it back would truly be a slap in the face for the rapporteur and the House after all the work they have done.
I move that we proceed to the vote.
