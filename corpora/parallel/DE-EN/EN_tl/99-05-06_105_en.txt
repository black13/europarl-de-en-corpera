Mr President, I have great admiration for Mr Jarzembowski, and in particular I admire the tenacity he shows in pursuit of his objectives.
Having failed to achieve them through the content, because we rejected all his amendments by a large majority in committee, he is naturally trying the legal route, and I certainly have no problems with that.
The only thing is that the legal situation has been unequivocally clarified, by your legal services for example.
We have also proceeded in the manner advised, recommended and urged by Mr Jarzembowski himself in the committee, and even confirmed the first reading in committee.
These matters have been thoroughly discussed, Mr President; I consider it right and proper that we should vote on this today as you proposed.
I would ask you to stand by your view and take this vote today.
