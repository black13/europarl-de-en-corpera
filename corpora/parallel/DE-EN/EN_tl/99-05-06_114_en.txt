Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, things are livening up again, and so they should!
I am afraid I have to invoke Rule 129 and request that the report be referred back to committee.
It is not a matter of having no agreement with Mexico, but rather of our perception of our role as a parliament.
A year ago, we decided to approve an interim agreement so that the overall agreement could be negotiated, and at the time we explicitly said that we would not approve the overall agreement until all of its component parts had been negotiated.
And that is precisely what has not yet been done.
If we want to exercise our powers of control, not least on behalf of the European people, we should have absolutely no qualms about putting this agreement on hold and voting on it when all the pieces are in place.
The Mexican Parliament approved the agreement on the proviso that the government would consult it again at the end when the whole agreement was completed.
That is how we see our function here in Parliament, and that is why I would ask you to endorse my motion.
