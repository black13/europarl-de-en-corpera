I wish to second that, and I should also like to thank Renzo Imbeni for his proposal.
I spoke to Mr Rugova on the phone last night.
I would ask that we be given the opportunity to see him even before the committee meeting in June, because he will be in demand over the next few weeks and, I fear, will be misused by some people.
For that reason, I believe it is important that we should grasp the opportunity to speak to him very soon.
If you can find a way of making that point to the President, it would certainly suit our purposes.
I should be willing to sacrifice a few slots on my electioneering schedule to that end.
