Mr President, this is not only about Mr Öcalan or about whether or not he is to be put on trial.
I come from Germany, and in my country Mr Öcalan would have received a trial.
This is about the fact that we rightly expect Turkey to ensure in the next few days or months that the procedure and outcome of this trial are in accordance with the rule of law.
That is what Europe legitimately expects of Turkey, a country with a great interest in becoming a member of the European Union.
If Turkey really does want to become a member of the European Union, it must show us how the rule of law applies to the treatment of a defendant in its trials.
That is the substance of this motion which we are discussing today and which we shall probably adopt tomorrow.
This expectation of ours must not be misinterpreted in Turkey.
The Turkish judicial authorities and the other Turkish authorities involved in this trial ultimately have a very important task.
If they genuinely want to bring about a peaceful settlement of the Kurdish problem, they must now treat Mr Öcalan properly as a defendant.
There can be no talk of his being guilty before the prosecution has proved its case in court.
He must be treated fairly at all costs, and his lawyers must not suffer harassment because they are representing him.
If Turkey maintains it is a European country, a country fit for the European Union, these European values, these Western standards, must be applied there.
We want no more than that, which is why we ask Turkey not to misunderstand these efforts that the European Parliament is making.
