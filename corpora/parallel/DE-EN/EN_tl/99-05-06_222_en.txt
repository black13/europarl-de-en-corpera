Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when we talk today about justice and security, we can begin with an example close to home.
A few weeks ago in front of the Parliament building in Brussels, a woman was murdered.
The important thing is that the culprit should be quickly arrested, brought to trial and fairly sentenced.
It is exactly the same with international human rights.
We cannot simply tolerate and accept the violation of human rights.
What we need is a system whereby offenders are extradited and made to face the consequences of their actions.
Justice and security, after all, are among the main pillars on which our European Union is built, and not only our European Union but also the applicant countries and the rest of the world.
We must campaign to ensure that our 15 Member States recognise the International Criminal Court and also that the rest of the world acknowledges these principles of justice and security.
