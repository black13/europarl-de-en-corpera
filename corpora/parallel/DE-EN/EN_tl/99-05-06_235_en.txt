Mr President, in a few days' time, the Czech Government will make its decision on the completion of the nuclear power station in Temelin.
Let me quote the report by the International Commission on Temelin, which said that there is currently an excess productive capacity and that power from the Temelin plant can only marginalise the use of other resources for power production.
The stage has already been reached when any solution to the Temelin project will have more adverse than beneficial effects.
Completion may bring even greater financial losses than discontinuing the construction work would cause.
Economically, then, the situation is very tricky to downright crazy.
And yet Western industries are still trying to make money there and have no compunction about possibly creating economic difficulties for a young democracy which, I hope, will very soon be a member of the European Union.
The International Atomic Energy Agency formulates minimum technical safety standards for nuclear plants which even nuclear power stations in the third world could satisfy.
That is well known.
This assessment does not come from me, but from very high-ranking diplomats and scientists.
I consider that to be an insult to the Czech Government and an affront to the Czech people.
In its conclusion of 7 December 1998 on nuclear safety, the Council, distancing itself from the IAEA, speaks of a 'high level of nuclear safety'.
That is quite a different matter!
If I may quote the Temelin report again, it says that the release of radioactive substances will be prevented by a simple concrete shell in the event of a nuclear accident.
How simple, I wonder!
The report also states that the long-term storage of radioactive waste will be assured in due course.
So when and where will it be stored?
Whatever the answers to these questions, I should like to thank all of my colleagues, particularly those from my own group, who intend to vote in favour of this resolution today.
