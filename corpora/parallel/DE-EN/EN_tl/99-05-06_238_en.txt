Mr President, it is the sovereign right of every state, including the Czech Republic, to decide which primary sources of energy it uses.
But the European Parliament must focus on the following point: all these matters have a bearing on the Community too and affect every one of us.
In the case of power plants, this applies to safety standards, especially those governing the construction and operation of nuclear power stations, their fuel cycle and the disposal of their waste, and all of these things are important in the context of future accession treaties, because we cannot admit any new Member States which maintain lower safety standards than those which obtain in Western Europe by virtue of political decisions.
Secondly, this is about the free energy market and future participants in that market.
We shall naturally be unable to tolerate a situation in which customers can freely obtain electricity from producers who do not apply the common safety standards and thereby secure competitive advantages in an unacceptable way.
These are the two Community aspects that we in Parliament must discuss.
That is why it is right to adopt this resolution.
That is why it is right that the Commission should deliver its opinion on the present reports too, because we have a duty to the European people to create transparency publicly here on this important issue.
So it is certainly not a matter of the Czech Republic and Austria alone but rather about the European public, and we must remember that if we are to fulfil the mandate from our electorate.
