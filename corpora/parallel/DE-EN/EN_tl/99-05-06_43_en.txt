Mr President, the need to ensure that European business remains competitive is one reason why the creation of a uniform legal framework for electronic commerce is indispensable.
In this particular field, common rules are one of the main prerequisites for efficient commercial transactions.
At the same time, due consideration must be given to the safety aspect and to protection from illegal activities and health hazards.
Regular commercial abuse of the Internet is one of the unfortunate realities of cyberspace that cannot be ignored.
Effective control mechanisms are therefore essential.
On the one hand, the development of software for the recognition of illegal content must be supported with a view to ensuring that these controls are more than a token gesture.
We must therefore forge ahead with the promotion of the necessary research projects.
On the other hand, however, I believe we should also consider whether the only type of control that is likely to be effective, namely control by the provider, cannot be effected in future in a technically and economically expedient way.
Public access to the information made available by providers would be appropriate in the light of the special responsibility borne by providers of online services.
Let me conclude by dealing with a very specific problem.
Among the possibilities opened up by the draft directive is the purchase of medicinal products without expert advice, which, as Mrs Heinisch said, creates a potential health risk that must not be underestimated.
Moreover, the Internet offers opportunities for large-scale fraud at the expense of patients, as the WHO, along with other bodies, has repeatedly stressed.
These things have to be borne in mind.
Although the draft directive, when all is said and done, is a step in the direction of an Internet that would serve the best interests of society, there is still a long way to go before that aim can be achieved.
