Mr President, I should like to draw the attention of the House to a necessary addition.
During the conciliation process and the trialogue, we agreed that the text of Amendment No 2 on Article 1(2) must henceforth read: 'this limit may be increased up to 2 %'.
The same agreement applies to Amendment No 1, relating to recital 4.
In the text before us, however, the word 'up' has only been inserted once.
May I ask you, once we have voted, to make that adjustment, so that the word 'up' is also inserted into Amendment No 1.
That is what was agreed between the Commission and the Council.
