Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to endorse the line of argument advanced by Detlev Samland and to add the following comment: the case-law you have quoted, Mr President, derives from a judgment which states that the institutions may not relax the provisions on required majorities which have been adopted in the Treaty.
This does not, however, mean that the institutions are not autonomous enough to decide to increase the required majority in a particular situation, for example in order to enhance the binding effect ascribed to the maximum rate of increase in Article 203.
This is a further argument in favour of the position taken by the Committee on Budgets.
We are making a change here and are fixing the maximum rate of increase for the next seven years.
The House would do well to ensure that this decision carries the support of a qualified majority.
