Mr President, at its meeting on Monday, which was authorised by you and was properly convened, the Committee on Budgets took its basic decision on the adoption or rejection of the interinstitutional agreement.
A majority of the committee voted for adoption.
Since we could not vote before Monday on the resulting amendments and since you had specially authorised us to meet then, because the trialogue at which we negotiated the outcome with the Council only took place last week, the committee adopted the relevant amendments immediately after voting for the agreement.
These amendments were properly adopted and were presented to the House within the prescribed time-limit.
In that respect, the House is behaving absolutely correctly by proceeding to the final vote now.
