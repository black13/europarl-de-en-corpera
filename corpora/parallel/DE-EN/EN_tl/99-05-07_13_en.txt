Madam President, I wholeheartedly endorse what Mrs Oomen-Ruijten said about your conduct of our business, but with all due respect I would urge that we should vote on the Jarzembowski report.
We discussed the possibility with the Legal Service of voting today and forwarding the results later, subject to receiving the approval of the Committee of the Regions.
There are still quite a lot of Members here for a Friday, which is why I would seriously urge you to hold the vote.
