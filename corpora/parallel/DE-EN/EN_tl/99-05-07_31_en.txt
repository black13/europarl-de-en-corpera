Madam President, I should like to begin by thanking Mr Hoppenstedt for all his hard work on this issue, and we all hope that Hanover will be a huge success.
It is extremely important for the European Union to be involved in an event like Expo 2000, which will attract enormous attention from the media and the public.
It is important to present an image of Europe for inward consumption, for the Union's own citizens, but also outwardly, for visitors from around the globe.
The EU must get closer to the people in its activities, raising its profile among passing trade, as it were, and the Expo is an ideal forum for this.
In the Committee on Culture too we have repeatedly stressed that the exhibition should not just show Europe's economic successes, but should also illustrate the European Union's cultural diversity and in particular its successful programmes.
I would also urge - and this is addressed to the organisers of the exhibition - that Parliament should be able to demonstrate its independent role in initiating these programmes, and it should be kept entirely separate from the Commission both in the pavilion and in the budget for the event.
Finally, I should also like to take the opportunity to urge the Council once again not just to be proud of our cultural achievements here, but to ensure that there is sufficient funding for the programmes, because there is absolutely no point in getting the public interested in all these wonderful programmes that the European Union organises if the level of funding is just a joke.
