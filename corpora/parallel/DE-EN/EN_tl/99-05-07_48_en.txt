Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking Mrs Ferrer, because I think that this is an extremely important initiative.
When sectors are in crisis, we must always ensure that we take the right measures in good time.
It is crucial that we should prepare for the WTO negotiating round in Seattle, and in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs I have always insisted that we should clearly identify the salient points here and that our main concern is access to third markets.
We must specifically ensure that these markets are opened up to us and that fair conditions are applied.
We also need to consider incentives in export marketing.
We must see to it that firms are able to offer their goods internationally so that Europe can be presented as a powerful force.
Another very important point is that we must ensure that a lighter burden is placed on SMEs in particular.
This is an issue to which I personally am very committed.
We have more than 16 million SMEs in the European Union, and they need to be given greater help and consideration here in the House in future.
Since I am the last speaker, I should also like to thank the President and his team, who have always worked so very hard here on Fridays.
I should also like to thank the President of the European Parliament, Mr Gil-Robles, for taking my initiatives to eliminate crime in and around the European institutions very seriously; our group chairman Mr Martens for promising not to forget this issue in future in Belgium and to continue to support us; the President-in-Office for promising to devote his efforts to this; and finally the Quaestors and the Conference of Presidents, for whom this issue has now become genuinely topical.
I am looking forward to seeing a safer Europe in the next parliamentary term.
Applause
