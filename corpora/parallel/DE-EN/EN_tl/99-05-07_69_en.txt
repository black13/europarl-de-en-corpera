Mr President, you seem to be being presented today with a bouquet made up of all the different cultures and languages of our various nations.
As someone born a Frenchwoman, I should like to add Germany's flower to this bouquet for you to take home in your heart, and I should like to wish you every success in your work for democracy, which is so important.
Applause
