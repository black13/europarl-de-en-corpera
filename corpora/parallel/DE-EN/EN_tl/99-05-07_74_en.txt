Mr President, I should like to thank you not just for being such an excellent leader of our Friday club, as many people have already mentioned, but for something else as well.
This morning Mrs Schleicher, who is also a member of the Friday club, said in the Chair at the beginning of the sitting 'The Rules of Procedure also apply to the Conference of Presidents'.
This has inspired me to thank you for being a vice-president who has always stood up for the rights of individual Members.
The Friday club itself consists of people who stand up for the rights of Members, and I very much hope that we will be able to continue to work together on this in the next parliamentary term.
