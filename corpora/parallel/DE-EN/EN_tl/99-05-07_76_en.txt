Mr President, I too would like to thank you.
I cannot for the moment find the rule that I need in the Rules of Procedure, but I would like to say, finally, that this was a parliamentary term which took Europe a little further forward, but took the European Parliament a great deal further forward.
We have three new Member States, and I hope that the Amsterdam Treaty and the excellent spirit that you have generated with your sense of humour will enable us to make considerable progress towards a democratic Europe.
I wish all those colleagues who are not coming back every success and good health in the future, and I wish those who are coming back the strength to stand up for a democratic Europe.
