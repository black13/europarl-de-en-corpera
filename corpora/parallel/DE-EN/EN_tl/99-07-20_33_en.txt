Madam President, the deadline you have set can easily be adhered to by those parties that only have one good candidate for the election of the Quaestors.
Unfortunately, our party has several good candidates and we must first make a selection.
Indeed, since the election will not take place first thing tomorrow morning, I would ask you to defer the deadline to ten o'clock this evening for example, or as far as I am concerned, even to midnight, but to make it no earlier than ten o'clock this evening.
I urge you to do this on behalf of my party.
