Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Bangemann's decision to accept a position on the board of directors of Telef√≥nica represents an unacceptable breach of political ethics.
Such behaviour endangers the reputation of European institutions and engenders reservations on the part of citizens towards the European Union.
This makes it all the more pressing to take effective measures in the fight against corruption and to introduce clear and open regulations for the proper application of Article 213 of the Treaty.
Legally binding regulations must be created, similar to those in private industry, which contain a competition clause or a competition restraint clause in employment contracts.
Naturally, Mr Bangemann has to take personal responsibility for his actions, but a policy geared towards economic interests as a matter of priority and, unfortunately, towards the business management interests of large concerns, also as a matter of priority, poses the inevitable risk that their leading representatives, as those putting this policy into practise, adopt the same attitude, thereby devoting themselves to maximising their personal profit, in violation of every moral code.
In order that an example can be made of Mr Bangemann for future generations as an unfortunate, one-off practitioner of amoral behaviour, the case against the former leader of the FDP, the party which, typically enough, carries the nickname in Germany 'Party of the Self-seekers' , must be upheld at the European Court of Justice.
