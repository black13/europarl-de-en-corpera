Madam President, I am able to confirm the comments made by my colleague, Mr Bar√≥n Crespo.
However, I wish to draw attention to another item, that of the name of our group.
Under item 5, it says 'formation of political groups' .
I should like to inform you that in future our group is to be known as the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats)/European Democrats and would ask that note be taken of this.
I would also ask that note be taken, on the monitors and the other technical installations, of the fact that our group is now the largest group in the Parliament, something of which many people are already aware.
Applause
