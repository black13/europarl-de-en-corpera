Mr President, it is a shame that Mr President-in-Office of the Council is now leaving the hall as I was going to begin by offering a word of praise.
I was going to say that he has been one of the few, if not the only, shining lights under this Presidency.
Mr Swoboda mentioned the new majority, yes the new majority gives the profile and views of this Parliament clarity, and that is good for Europe, Mr Swoboda.
Applause
Unfortunately, I have no option but to grade the German Presidency as overall 'unsatisfactory' for the first six months of this year.
The grandiose announcement of a new Employment Pact turned out in reality to be a castle in the air.
When analysing the Cologne Decisions in detail, it is possible to see that not one new idea was added to the Luxembourg guidelines of the previous year.
Secondly, the language and style adopted by the German Government over the last six months have at times caused me to feel ashamed in the European Parliament.
This style has been of no use to Europe and it has certainly been of no use to the German Presidency.
Mr Trittin's loutish conduct in terminating the nuclear Treaties led of course to the German Presidency's proposals being regarded with great scepticism.
The shameful withdrawal of the sound proposal for co-financing in agricultural policy was also the consequence of a similarly ill-advised policy.
And to cap it all, I might add that Chancellor Schr√∂der said Helmut Kohl's cheque book diplomacy must at last be brought to an end!
I do not wish to say any more at all on the nomination of the German candidate, which in view of the choice, was a resounding slap in the face, and so to conclude I shall express a wish.
As long as the dictator Milosevic is at the helm in Serbia, neither a penny nor a euro of the European taxpayer's money should go to Serbia.
Democracy must first be restored there.
That is the message the Council Presidency should take away with it.
Applause
