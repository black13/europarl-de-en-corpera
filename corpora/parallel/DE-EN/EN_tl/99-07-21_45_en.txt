Mr President, you have had a declaration distributed to us and a trial vote has subsequently taken place.
The name of the candidate selected is visible and is also emphasised by the asterisk.
I should be grateful if you could explain to us how, under the circumstances, we are to vote in secret.
I regard it as being anything but a secret ballot and wish to contest its legitimacy before we go any further.
It is illegal.
We vote in secret here, and not in such a way that everyone can see how people cast their votes, and that includes the cameras present in this house.
I do not consider that a secret ballot.
Applause
