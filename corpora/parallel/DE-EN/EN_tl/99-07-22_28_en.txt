Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Fischler, in this dreadful state of affairs, we must take note of the fact that here clearly systematically toxic substances have been recycled via animal feed.
You have talked about product contamination being the starting point of this crisis, but there is still no apparent mishap to which blame can be attributed.

I hope that they can now be transposed quickly.
Above all else Mr Fischler, the question of maximum values must be tied in with a ban on mixing or else this systematic disposal will continue.
