Mr President, this House is expected to produce at last one clear statement in relation to the dioxin crisis.
I would sum this up by saying that on the question of health, we do not want to enter into a compromise, nor do we want to compromise on the issue of industrial crimes.
This crisis, just like the BSE crisis, is throwing up questions which we must answer, both in concrete terms and also very quickly.
Are the resources which we have allocated to carry out checks sufficient at the end of the day?
And are they efficient?
To what extent are crises of this sort also an opportunity for certain Member States, as the Commissioner has just mentioned, to set up additional trade barriers over and above the measures imposed?
What resources shall we place at our disposal, together with the Commission and especially with the Council, so that definite checks and early warning systems can be introduced?
I am raising these issues because I am of the opinion that we do not have to answer these questions in tedious or prolonged committees of enquiry.
Nor am I convinced that a government Commissioner responsible for dealing with a crisis in a country will concern himself with efficiency and credibility.
Let us simply show, at our level and at a national level, that we possess the political will to act rather than simply to analyse.
The consumer expects a swift and efficient response, not contradictory statements by experts who engender more mistrust than trust with consumers.
Quick, efficient action is also expected by farmers since, in our country, in Belgium, well over 90 % of farmers are victims of this crisis.
We should not punish these farmers who have invested many years in the quality and also the clarity of their controls.
I therefore ask you not to give a de facto refusal to provide financial assistance within the framework of the European Union.
We know, in the meantime, how crises originate; now we must finally provide ourselves with the means of avoiding them.
