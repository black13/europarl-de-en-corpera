Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all it was cattle and BSE, now the fuss is all about poultry and dioxin.
I do not want to know what will be next.
Therefore, I cannot repeat often enough the importance of maintaining animals in proper conditions and having a food processing industry which is conscious of its responsibilities.
The chain begins with the farmers, but then leads via the foodstuffs industry to our dinner plates.
As far as I am concerned, the most important thing is a healthy diet, and this is something which concerns us all.
Therefore, we all have a responsibility.
I do not want to insinuate anything, yet clearly precautionary measures and careful inspections in an area as sensitive as the human food chain were disregarded.
Extra special care is necessary when we are talking about highly toxic substances such as dioxins.
All of us here know that dioxin was used in the Vietnam war and I would also today like to remember Seveso.
Therefore, we need a comprehensible labelling system for the foodstuffs industry as well.
The image of all Austrian foodstuffs is being damaged by such incidents.
European agriculture will be an important topic for discussion at the next WTO round and the world market will pose immense problems for us over the next few years.
One possibility for our continuing survival is quality production in the EU.
Our foods must be safe and healthy.
This must be our trademark and represent an opportunity for our farmers.
We must do everything we can to allay consumer fears.
Quality must take precedence but quality also has its price, ladies and gentlemen.
In this regard, I welcome the establishment of an independent European Food Agency.
In the long run, we will all benefit from it.
Applause
