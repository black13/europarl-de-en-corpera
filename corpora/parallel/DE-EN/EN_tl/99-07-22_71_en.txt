Madam President, I would already have asked for the Minutes to have been approved this morning if I had seen that Annex III had not been distributed for our perusal.
This morning, we found on our seats the Minutes containing two Annexes while the third Annex had not been distributed.
They were only pigeonholed over the course of the morning.
I wish to protest at this and would like to ask about the reasoning behind it.
Approval of the Minutes dictates that all three Annexes, and not just two, are available.
Secondly, I wish to point out that the third Annex contains the composition of the committees of delegations, and I would like to ask whether yesterday, when we took a vote on this issue - which is what apparently happened - whether the lists with the names and the composition were available or whether we took a vote without knowledge of the composition.
I consider this to be an unheard of sequence of events if no appropriate submission was forthcoming.
