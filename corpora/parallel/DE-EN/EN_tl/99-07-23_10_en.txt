Madam President, firstly, I would like to point out that the German interpreting service has clearly failed.
However, I also have a second point: are you aware of the significance of Mr Posselt's explanation?
If the error, as pointed out by Mr Posselt stands, we do not have a properly elected President and Vice-President in the delegations.
This is an extremely serious matter and must therefore be treated with urgency.
I would ask that this be clarified and dealt with as soon as possible by the Bureau because this means we are entering the summer recess with a completely unclear situation with regard to the delegations and this must not happen in this Parliament.
Applause
