Madam President, today's Minutes include an Annex indicating that the Bureaux of delegations of the joint parliamentary committees for Associated States have already been elected.
However, if you read the Rules of Procedure, you will see that Rule 170(6) states that the appointment of the joint parliamentary committees is somewhat different from the interparliamentary delegations and must therefore be carried out under the same conditions as the appointment of the committees.
This is how we have done it in the past.
This means that elections must take place as for the committees.
The fact that there are discussions between the groups of parties is another matter altogether.
So, in the case of interparliamentary delegations, the Plenum decides, whereas in the case of the joint parliamentary committees for Associated States, in my opinion, Rule 170(6) applies.
I would like to make that point.
There is a second point which I would also like to make.
The deadline for submitting the relevant proposals was ten o'clock yesterday.
However, the proposals - that is, the preliminary draft - on which we voted did not reach us until after ten o'clock and so I must call the entire vote into question.
I would ask you to consider both points and give me your feedback at the next sitting.
