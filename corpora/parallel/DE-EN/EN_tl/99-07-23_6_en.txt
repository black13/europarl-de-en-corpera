Madam President, I have a question on Wednesday's Minutes, or, more specifically, on Annex 3 which was first distributed yesterday afternoon and which contains the proposals for nominations to the Bureaux of interparliamentary delegations.
I would like to know whether the typing error, which is actually binding, has since been corrected.
It meant that my colleague Sumberg from the PPE Group would have become a deputy chairperson in two of these delegations, i.e. for Japan and China.
In actual fact, colleague Jarzembowski has become deputy chairperson for the Japan delegation.
Has this been corrected and is this binding?
