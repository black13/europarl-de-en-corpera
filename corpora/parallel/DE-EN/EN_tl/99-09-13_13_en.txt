Madam President, a word regarding the Minutes.
I just want to point out that in the Minutes from last Friday, one of my interventions was not properly reproduced.
I was pointing out that, in accordance with our Rules of Procedure, the joint parliamentary committees, unlike the delegations, but just like the committees, have to elect their bureaux.
This is not properly reflected in the Minutes.
All that is contained is my protest that the documents were not distributed on time.
I request that it be made clear that we in the joint parliamentary committees also have to hold elections just as is the case in the parliamentary committees.
