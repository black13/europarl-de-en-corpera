Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following the crisis of confidence we have experienced this year, there has been a lot of talk about the need for a new beginning in relations between the Commission and Parliament.
A new beginning of this kind is in fact necessary.
Mistrust on the part of Parliament arose as soon as documents concerning cases of fraud landed on the desks of newspaper editors but not on those of the Committee.
It was unacceptable for amendments proposed by this Chamber simply to be ignored by the Commission and for any officials who referred to mismanagement also still to be punished for this.
All this, in fact, makes a new beginning necessary.
However, I still have some reservations even after the long preparatory phase this new Commission has been through.
I should like to quote three reasons for this.
Firstly, political responsibility must also be accepted by each individual.
Each Member of the Commission is responsible and answerable for his department.
Not all candidates see it like this.
Secondly, there are still doubts about the Commissioner-designate responsible for research.
I expect you, Mr Prodi, to produce a further statement of your position regarding this matter.
Thirdly, because the former Commissioners are again standing as candidates, there is still in the end the question of the terms in which they understand their political responsibility as part of a collegiate body.
Europe' s citizens are entitled to expect transparency and proper supervision and a policy which accepts, undivided, that responsibility which has been transferred to it.
We have our justified doubts as to whether this has in fact been guaranteed for the future.
