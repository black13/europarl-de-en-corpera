Mr President, and in particular Mr President-designate of the Commission, I have good and bad news for you.
First, the good news.
As a person and as President of the Commission, you also have the confidence of those Members of the European Parliament who are very sceptical about your team.
In other words, you personally will be able to count on a "yes" vote from our group in both elections.
Now for the bad news.
It has emerged in the course of the hearings that, in addition to brilliant, excellent Commissioners, you have evidently also had to present to us Commissioners who are merely average or below average and, unfortunately, one or two who are just not qualified for the job at all.
In other words, we naturally have reservations about Mr Busquin in particular.
When scandal is never far behind a person, experience dictates that sooner or later it catches up on him.
Although I well understand that you have limited room for manoeuvre, there really has to be a change in personnel when serious criticisms like this are being made.
Bar√≥n Crespo said this morning that one particular refractory minister in Bavaria would not have resigned.
Well, I have news for him.
The minister resigned yesterday before the vote in Parliament.
I fear however that, unfortunately, it will probably be another century before the European Commission achieves the efficiency of the Bavarian state administration.
Mr President of the Commission, with all due respect for yourself and the estimable ladies and gentlemen of your team, if you do not arrange for Mr Busquin in particular to be replaced, then a number of my colleagues will unfortunately feel compelled to not yet be able to affirm their confidence in this Commission.
The chance to embark upon a genuinely new era in Europe must now be seized courageously and energetically.
