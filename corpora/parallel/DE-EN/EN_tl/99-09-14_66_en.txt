Madam President, on page 6 of the Minutes it says that Mr Posselt clarified his remarks at the beginning of the sitting.
I want to say something about this.
Firstly, I made no remarks at all at the beginning of the sitting and, secondly, this clarification of mine yesterday would appear to have been to no avail, since there is again no mention in the Minutes of what I actually said, and the next point in fact contradicts what I said.
I should therefore like to repeat my comments.
I indicated last plenary week that, according to our Rules of Procedure, the plenum decides about the Bureaux of the delegations but that, again, according to our Rules of Procedure, the joint parliamentary committees, just like the parliamentary committees (that is to say, the normal specialised committees of Parliament) have to hold elections to their Bureaux, just as we have done in the internal committee in all committees.
This also has to happen with the joint parliamentary committees in third countries.
I have touched upon this matter on a number of occasions here, and there has never been any reaction, although it is clearly stated in the Rules of Procedure.
I again referred to this matter yesterday when the Minutes of the Friday sitting of the last part-session were adopted.
Now, the Minutes state that I clarified my remarks (but do not go on to state what I actually said) and then list at the back who' s who in the Bureaux of these joint parliamentary committees.
This is incorrect, though.
What instead we are concerned with here are proposals which still have to be voted on in the joint parliamentary committees once these have been constituted.
