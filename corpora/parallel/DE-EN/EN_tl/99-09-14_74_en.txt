Mr President, Mr Prodi, in your speech on 21 July 1999 you said that your bywords were transparency, a sense of responsibility and efficiency.
It is precisely in the area of budget policy that these three basic principles need to be given concrete expression.
If we want to win back the confidence of our citizens, we need transparency regarding the implementation of the EU budget in all its details, a sense of responsibility in handling tax revenue and efficiency in transposing Community budget policies.
Clearly, this is a task for the Commission as a whole, all Commissioners and all departments.
In the person of Mrs Schreyer you have introduced us to an experienced politician who still has to find her way around one or two corridors here and go through one or two new experiences at a European level but who is also, however, someone who has become quickly and comprehensively acquainted with the very complicated material of budget policy and who is very aware of the forthcoming challenges of budget policy.
She has set out budgetary discipline as being, for her, one of the cardinal virtues.
This is praiseworthy stuff.
However, we shall also take care to ensure that it is not just a question here of describing new tasks and slipping these into our budget.
Instead, we shall need, together with yourself, to go before the Council and say that new tasks require new money.
I was gratified to hear Mrs Schreyer say, very undiplomatically, that the distinction between non-compulsory and compulsory funds has to be removed.
This would mean equal rights for all parts of the Parliament.
A courageous statement like that is worth repeating.
She also said that control over revenue needs to be shifted in this direction, something we must set about discussing very soon.
I think Mrs Schreyer is among those proposed candidates who will do full justice to their tasks in this Parliament.
We shall have no cause - over here at least - to doubt your team.
