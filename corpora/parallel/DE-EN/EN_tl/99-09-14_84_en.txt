Mr President, with the approval of the Prodi Commission, the European Parliament will tomorrow draw a line under the scandal of the Santer Commission.
I hope that in the process, we shall also overcome an understandable degree of mistrust on the part of Europe' s citizens and create a new confidence in the European Union.
However, drawing a line under the matter does not mean just filing it away.
The European Parliament will remain alert and keep a sharp eye on the Commission in future too.
That is why we were elected by the peoples of Europe.
We shall ensure that, if need be, individual Members of the Commission are removed if they are no longer acceptable for professional or personal reasons.
I am convinced that, for example, Mr Bolkestein would fail the test tomorrow if, in appointing the Commission, we had the opportunity to vote on individual Commissioners.
A Commissioner responsible for the internal market who, during the hearings, was forever mouthing the word "subsidiarity" has clearly not understood enough about the great common tasks facing Europe.
The people of Europe expect to benefit from a leadership which focuses upon the common good and not upon the sum total of individual interests in the Member States.
When Mr Bolkestein learns to understand this, then he may go on to share for a long time in the success which I wish Mr Prodi and his Commission.
If he does not, then he is a candidate for the sack.
Mr Prodi, since Mr Bolkestein is still not back yet, I trust you will pass the message on to him.
