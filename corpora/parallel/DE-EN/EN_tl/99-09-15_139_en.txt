Mr President, of course we are committed to supporting the efforts of the people of East Timor in their fight for independence and democracy.
But what form should this support take?
As Europeans, we cannot behave like schoolmasters in a conflict in South-East Asia.
In so doing, we will not engender any trust on the part of those people in Asia who would be important partners as regards the democratisation of this country.
Above all, the disintegration and balkanisation of South-East Asia can surely not be Europe' s goal.
The question was therefore asked in the leader in today 's issue of the Herald Tribune: "Who are these Western crusaders to be lecturing the Asians?" - a question that may be a bitter pill for us to swallow.
Our responsibility, as Europeans, is to support democratic development, which will also result in an improvement in the living conditions of the people.
Perhaps, we will first have to learn as Europeans how to support a people in a foreign land in their fight for independence, as well as along their path to a democratic form of society.
