Madam President, may I remind all those present, and yourself, that in this week 55 years ago a forgotten concentration camp, located in our immediate vicinity here, was liberated.
The Natzwiller-Struthof Camp was one of the most gruesome of the Nazi camps, where thousands of people met their death due to medical experiments.
It also contained one of the few gas chambers not located in the large extermination camps of Eastern Europe.
I would therefore like to ask whether it would be possible for Parliament to have a plaque made.
Secondly, I would like to suggest that we send a delegation there on the occasion of the next anniversary of its liberation.
