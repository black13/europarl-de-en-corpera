Mr President, I have a question concerning how events will run in practice.
What would happen today if a neutral Member State was attacked militarily by a non-EU State?
What would you do and which course of action would you recommend?
We have just recently had a military crisis between the borders of two EU countries, namely between Greece and Austria.
What plan would you have if a military attack were to take place today against an EU country, even if it were a neutral EU country?
How would you proceed as President-in-Office of the Council?
