Madam President, the summit on internal policy in Tampere is a historic milestone in the development of the European Union.
Only a few years ago, the governments of Member States were not prepared to co-operate with the European Parliament on important matters such as collaboration between police forces, migration or common asylum policy.
The time has come for the European Union to lay foundations after Amsterdam.
The results of Tampere will determine how democratic and how just the Union will be, if it is really to be an area of freedom, security and justice for all citizens, male and female.
As yet I have not seen any documents from the Finnish Presidency.
Even in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, the Ministers for Justice and Home Affairs remain too vague.
We have not seen much sign of great Nordic transparency.
I must therefore refer to documents from Germany about Tampere.
I regret that once again we have to have a debate on internal politics in this Parliament without having the documents of the Council Presidency on the table.
In this connection, I would like to make it clear that my group is very concerned particularly if, in Tampere, the areas of collaboration between police forces, the fight against drugs, data protection and the democratic control of Europol and the Schengen information system are discussed, because we are again afraid, that it is exactly these important points, which have really great significance for European democracy, which will come off badly and that the citizens in general will find in the end that, as far as their rights are concerned, they are the real losers.
I am still hopeful, but previous experience has made me pessimistic.
I hope that the Finnish Presidency of the Council will take our reservations seriously.
