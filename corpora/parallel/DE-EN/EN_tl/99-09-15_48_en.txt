Madam President, many thanks for your tolerance and patience!
A fellow member of the European People' s Party described his Party as being friends of security, as if there were any enemies of security in this House!
I think the problem is rather that many are not the friends of freedom and the law to the same extent.
Therefore, I also believe that the most pressing task consists of achieving the prerequisites for an area of freedom, security and justice, specifically a Charter of Fundamental Rights in Europe, because the important thing is not only to centralise the sensitive application of State and police authority, but also to europeanise the rights of citizens.
Now the Cologne Summit has decided upon the proclamation of just such a European list of fundamental rights, a laudable intention.
But when one looks at the manner in which this has been planned, then one can only, as a Member of Parliament, be shocked.
The Council has - for what reasons, I do not understand - assumed total responsibility for this list of fundamental rights.
There was no dialogue with the European Parliament.
This is unacceptable, given that the European Parliament has the role of representing the peoples of Europe and is thus the original authority for such a Charter of Fundamental Rights.
There can be no question of equivalence of legislative institutions in this process.
The inclusion of national parliaments has involved only individual representatives, so there can be no question either of plurality of political tendencies in this process.
What is most worrying and most alarming is the scope of the undertaking.
Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I believe there is one thing we should not do and that is to fulfil the fundamental requirements of the citizens in appearance only.
A proclamation of already existing rights is no Charter of Fundamental Rights, but political versemongering!
