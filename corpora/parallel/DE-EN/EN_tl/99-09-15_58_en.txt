Madam President, the Finnish Presidency of the Council has a very great responsibility.
Many are looking towards Tampere with great hopes and are expecting considerable steps towards a Europe for the citizens.
Here, I believe that the Charter of Citizens' Rights is a unique opportunity to say to people from Scandinavia to the Mediterranean that this Europe is not only a single market.
It is not only a single currency.
Rather, this Europe is a community of values designed to defend and promote the achievements in terms of civilisation which we in Europe have fought for over recent centuries.
The Charter of Citizens' Rights can only be of interest if the method behind its preparation is open and transparent.
This should not therefore entail a traditional Intergovernmental Conference behind closed doors.
This Charter must be drawn up openly in dialogue with the citizens.
I believe that citizens' rights is an original theme for the European Parliament and national parliaments alike.
In this regard, I am of the opinion that the Tampere Summit should make considerable strides forward and allow the European Parliament a greater involvement than was agreed in Cologne.
It is certainly a question of European citizens' rights.
In this respect, we should really ensure parity between representatives of this European Parliament and representatives at a national level.
I believe that citizens will only take an interest in this Charter if it amounts to more than a solemn proclamation.
Citizens' rights must also be binding in law.
I hope that this debate points the way ahead as to how these rights can be incorporated in the next treaties.
Open debate and legal incorporation; then we will have the opportunity to get to know Europe' s citizens once again.
