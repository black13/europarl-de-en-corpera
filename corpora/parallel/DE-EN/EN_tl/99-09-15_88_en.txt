Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are a plethora of reasons for rejecting the Commission.
First of all, I would like to again recall the political imbalance of the Commission.
Following the landslide election victory of the Christian Democrats, this Commission does not reflect their majority standing in Parliament.
As far as I am concerned, this is simply not acceptable.
Furthermore, in Mr Busquin from Belgium and Mr Lamy from France, we have two people in the Commission who, it has been proven, are embroiled in scandal.
If we here today want to embark on a new beginning, then, as I see it, such a new beginning will just not be possible with both of these gentlemen, and the citizens of Europe have a right to expect that we parliamentarians ensure that only persons of impeccable character feature in this Commission.
This is not the case in this instance.
Here, it is again a question of, if I may put it this way, cast-off national politicians.
As a Parliament, we did not act the way we did in January so as to elect people in September who are worse than those whom we sent packing in January!
