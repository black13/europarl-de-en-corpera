Mr President, it is not that the Greens have no other speakers, it is just that we had a technical hitch, so this is my own contribution.
As a European of Turkish origin, I definitely wished to comment on the earthquake in Greece.
I believe my Greek friends will understand me if, as a European from Germany, even though of Turkish origin, I say "silipitiria" (my condolences), and I say this on behalf of all people from Turkey.
Indeed, this earthquake in Greece - enough has been said about Turkey - although it resulted in many victims, has achieved much more than hundreds of motions for resolution could.
Precisely in this period of peace between Greece and Turkey we have an opportunity, here in the European Parliament, to bring the people of both countries together and to finally purge what they kept trying to teach me, and probably you too, in school in our history books, i.e. that Greece and Turkey supposedly hate each other.
That is an outrageous lie!
In fact Turkey and Greece have a great deal in common, and for this reason you can perhaps understand if I, a Green Member of Parliament from Germany, have made such an emotional speech.
I wanted to express my gratitude to you and, in connection with the earthquake disaster in Greece, to again express my "silipitiria" .
