Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, five year ago it was the Chechen war which concerned us on a daily basis.
Thanks to pressure from this European Parliament, decisive diplomatic steps were then taken.
The risk of a major conflagration was already colossal, and they were successful, at the time, in damping things down.
But there was no follow up action.
In the action programme on Russia, which has already been mentioned today, this specific region is omitted and, in the dramatic poverty which predominates there, extremists of course have an easy job of it.
If we have an interest in a concept of security embracing all of Europe, we cannot be indifferent to the situation in the Caucasus.
As anyone familiar with the region knows, it is more difficult than ever for measures to be taken in the area, and therefore in our resolution we prescribed only a verification mission, to begin with.
As we know, there is no one at the present time who is prepared to go there.
Nonetheless, the people there are in real need of humanitarian aid, and this must take priority.
But even the extension of the mandate of the OSCE mission in terms of finance and personnel should be checked seriously, and I request Mr Kinnock to assign Mr Patten to report to us in the Committee on Foreign Affairs on the results of this verification, so that we can reach further conclusions.
I consider this to be urgent, and I consider it to be our important contribution towards achieving stability in these regions.
