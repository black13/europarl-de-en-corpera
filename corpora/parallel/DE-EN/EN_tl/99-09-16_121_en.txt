Mr President, Mr Kinnock very clearly pointed out the risk that this problem presents for stability in Europe and throughout the world as a whole.
For there is a real danger that extremist forces may use this to bring about a state of emergency in Russia.
No one knows exactly what the background to this aggression is.
What is happening in Russia at present is extremely worrying.
We naturally condemn any form of extremism, but we must ascertain the precise background.
As regards Chechnya and Dagestan, this is the long-term damage left by a brutal colonial regime, which we will only get to grips with little by little.
We must therefore urge most strongly, firstly that Russia must respect its obligations resulting from the peace agreement with Chechnya and must resume reconstruction work there.
Secondly action must be taken to prevent destabilisation of the ethnic balance in Dagestan.
