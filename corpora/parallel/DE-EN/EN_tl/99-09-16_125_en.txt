Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is the second time we have discussed Kosovo today.
We are now discussing a matter, in which little can be changed unless there is some goodwill on the part of the powers-that-be in Belgrade.
Unfortunately, neither the Kumanovo Agreement between Nato and the Yugoslavian government nor the UN Resolution which gave the mandate for the international presence in Kosovo made any mention of the situation of the Albanian prisoners in Belgrade and the missing persons.
Here too we should have learnt from our experience in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
Today, three years after Dayton, we still do not know where many of the missing people are.
On a weekly basis I receive queries from families who are still looking for missing persons, and who have not received any details.
What sort of people are these who detain thousands of their fellow men for years in inhumane conditions for no good reason, leaving the family members of these prisoners, the wives, mothers and children, in ignorance as to their fate?
Perhaps we should appeal to them less as politicians and authorities in this region than as the father or sons they also are.
Unfortunately we cannot compel them.
The Serbian regime leaves us no formal means to do this.
But its conduct goes against any conception of legality, never mind humanity.
We therefore call on the UN Administrator, Kouchner, and also the OSCE, to seek a way to ensure their release.
We place our hopes in a sub-committee for problems of prisoners and exiles of the Kosovo Transitional Council.
But we expect all states in the international community not to lift any of the sanctions against Serbia until, among other things, these prisoners are released.
It is possible to have peaceful co-existence between Serbs and Albanians, and between Croats, Muslims and Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina, only if, among other things, the matter of prisoners and deportees is clarified.
