Mr President, the reconstruction in Kosovo is without a doubt one of the most urgent tasks, but also responsibilities, of the European Union.
According to the latest reports from the UN, Kosovo is today a completely devastated country in which neither people' s security is guaranteed nor the population' s nutritional needs provided for.
However, the European Union' s responsibility must this time involve more than merely financing the reconstruction.
The reinstatement of a democratically just system is a prerequisite for any reconstruction programme, and the EU bears political, just as much as social and economic, responsibility.
As the negative examples from Russia have shown in recent weeks, billions of dollars in aid often reach only a fraction of the people who are really affected by a crisis.
The flow of cash must therefore be transparent.
We must all be given a guarantee that Europeans' tax payments do not trickle away into the accounts of so many political and economic criminals.
The European Union is alone responsible for ensuring that this money is not misused.
As Members of Parliament, we have a responsibility towards our electors who are financing this reconstruction with their tax money.
We depend upon a positive opinion in the population and it is therefore a basic responsibility of the European Union to be able also to explain to those who are helping to finance the reconstruction how the money is being used.
For this, the European Union this time needs a modern, efficient, rationally managed and also transparent form of conflict management.
Only under these conditions can we count upon broad support for this project from the European population.
