Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, a lot has been said about the reconstruction of Kosovo.
You know that this Parliament has gone to the utmost trouble to find a compromise strategy, and we shall stand by this compromise strategy and are prepared to make our contribution to it.
I should like to touch upon two questions which do not directly concern reconstruction but which are of special importance for the future not only of Kosovo but also of the entire region.
About 15 days ago, the UN' s special envoy, Mr Kouchner, introduced a new currency to Kosovo.
I do understand the need for a stable currency, partly for the benefit of the work being done there.
What I do not understand, however, is the penalisation of the dinar, the official currency of the state to which Kosovo still belongs.
The second resolution contradicts the convictions of us all and also the agreement made between the UN, NATO and the KLA.
The KLA is not being disarmed, at least not completely.
Instead, there are still KLA units, only they now put on different uniforms and will still be armed.
Have we, as the European Union, an opinion on these resolutions, Mr Vice-President of the Commission and, if so, what is it?
