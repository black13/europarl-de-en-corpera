, rapporteur.
Mr President, I have been asked to briefly say something about the vote so that colleagues do not have to be attacked at home for something which is not the case.
I should like therefore to say what we are voting about.
We want no delay in providing aid to Kosovo, but we do want more efficiency.
The Council has proposed an inefficient procedure, and I would therefore ask it to be understood that we accept the headquarters in Thessaloniki as an operational component of the Reconstruction Agency for the whole of South-East Europe with its headquarters in Thessaloniki, but which must be closely linked with the headquarters of the Stability Pact in Thessaloniki.
That is an important political point.
I would ask you all to bear this in mind.
It is one of the essential points.
There are also two further points I must make here.
We should like to see a simplification of the administration.
We should like to see more transparency and more flexibility.
In fact, these points are to be found in our amendments.
We should also like the Council to include us as soon as it extends the work into other regions.
We must be made a part of this.
We should also like there, for the time being, to be a time limit of thirty months on the Agency' s work, for the longer we extend this, the more inefficient it becomes.
We should set ourselves a limit and try to achieve everything by then.
Another really important point is that OLAF must be deployed...
