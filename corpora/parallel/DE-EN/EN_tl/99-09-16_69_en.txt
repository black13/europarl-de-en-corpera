We Independents are in favour of transparent and efficient budget planning and supervision.
With regard to the Supplementary and Amending Budget for 1/99 and 3/99, we expressly emphasise that we shall judge the Supplementary and Amending Budget for 1/99 and 3/99 positively and also support it.
In the Supplementary and Amending Budget for 4/99, a considerable reduction in the resources for agricultural expenditure is specified.
This reduction in authorised payments and in other financial commitments increases the burden upon farms which are in great difficulty as it is.
For the reason mentioned, we cannot approve the entire Supplementary and Amending Budget.
(Parliament voted to hold the final vote over to the next part-session)
President.
Before we move to the last vote I should just like to explain to colleagues who thought I may have been a little harsh about separate votes, roll-call votes and so on that the reason we take a tough line is that groups prepare their whips on the basis of information from the presidency.
If we change that during voting time in plenary it causes a lot of confusion and difficulty.
So we try to be as helpful as possible but it could actually lead to more difficulty sometimes if we acceded to requests from the floor.
