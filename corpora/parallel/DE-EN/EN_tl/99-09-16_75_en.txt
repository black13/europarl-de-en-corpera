We Independents always stand up for defending basic rights and therefore also support efforts to create a Charter of Fundamental Rights for the European Union.
However, we do not understand this Charter as a step in the direction of a European constitution, which we reject because of the centralising effect this would have.
Any such Charter must also be designed in such a way that there can be no overlap of powers between the European Court of Justice and the European Court of Human Rights.
