Mr President, I too should like to congratulate Mr Kinnock on his new post.
I hope for worthwhile and constructive dialogue with him over the next few years.
As far as I am concerned, two basic questions arise from what Mr Titley has said.
Russia, as we know, is suffering not only from financial crisis, but also, and above all, from the erosion of basic democratic mechanisms such as transparency, public supervision of the administration and an independent judiciary.
In a situation like that, how can the difficult process of social transformation take place at all?
This is just what I have already been saying - our problem is that, in our action programme, we are setting false priorities for Russia.
The democratic bases of the market economy must be operating before we can create a free trade area.
On the other hand, it is evident that banks in the West have also been weak enough to permit money laundering and the mismanagement of money at an international level.
How can it have been possible for the destination of international credits not to have been understood?
How is it that money laundering on such a large scale is possible at all in the West?
These questions are also waiting to be answered.
