I am of the opinion, which Mr Andrews expressed, that we should not forget how to be grateful.
We should be grateful for the building, grateful for the working conditions which we now have in Strasbourg after 20 years and more of provisional arrangements.
We should also be grateful for the style and manner in which our President is taking on board our criticism.
That is worth repeating.
I consider today 's question time to be an absolute novelty.
Such a thing has not existed since the first direct elections in 1979.
I would like to suggest that this is organised at specific intervals for other matters besides this.
I consider discussion between the Parliament and the President to be very useful and necessary.
As regards the concrete matters, I am of the view that this building is certainly very fine and worthy, but it is also necessary, of course, to make full and fitting use of it.
Here I would like to take up what some Members have already said.
In order to utilise this building efficiently, we must ensure that we spend the whole of our plenary part-sessions here, including the Fridays, so that we then have an entire week in which, as Mrs Ludford suggested, we can devote ourselves specifically to constituency matters.
If we do not use this building properly, ending the plenary part-session as early as Thursday and making Thursday the last day of the week, then a backlog of work is created.
This backlog of work leads to innumerable additional plenary part-sessions.
Then we have a mishmash of sittings running from one week into the next.
I propose ...
