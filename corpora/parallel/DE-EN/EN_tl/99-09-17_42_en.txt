Mr President, there is a slogan "Black is beautiful."
I support it completely.
At the present time in Germany I see, from region to region, that black is stronger than red or green.
I consider this dominance to be a good thing.
But, despite that, we should be a little wary.
If too much black is used it can be rather dismal.
There have been improvements to the lifts.
I am pleased to see them.
But for a bar to resemble a night club all day long, in spite of the pretty flowery carpet, is surely not a development we can accept.
We have to be able to drink tea and coffee there.
We wish to meet each other in full view and not as shadowy figures.
I consider the business of the stairs to be rather more serious.
I too have been stuck in the lift a few times.
I am mobile enough to take the stairs down from the sixth or seventh floor.
But all the steps there are completely black.
I have seen male and female colleagues clinging anxiously to the banister, as they did not know where one step began and the other finished.
We need safety areas, as this can be very dangerous.
There is a danger of falling.
Some Members think we should have far more colours.
I have been working for 20 years in design.
We should keep to the principles.
The architects specified slate.
Slate doesn' t have to be just black, it can be white or silver or grey.
In other words, we have plenty of opportunities to make improvements using this colour scheme so that we do not have to work in a building in which not only does black express dignity but in which an excess of black leads to depression.
We should carefully move towards silver and other colours.
I believe that then we will finally be able to say that it stands for greater visibility, greater transparency, and we can show ourselves clearly instead of hiding ourselves.
