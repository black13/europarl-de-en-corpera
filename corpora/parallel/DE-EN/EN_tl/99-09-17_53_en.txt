Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly my thanks for the good things which have quite rightly been mentioned.
I would like to mention three points.
Firstly, services.
The cleaning personnel always used to do their work very early.
Arriving at the office at half past seven, one could work in peace.
Now they come much later.
If one wishes to be on time in the Chamber at 9 o' clock, the lifts are full of cleaning staff who take much longer to get in and out because they have their trolleys.
Would it not be possible to ensure that the cleaning staff do not carry out their work at a time which is the peak time for the Members of Parliament?
The times we work are well known.
Please give this further consideration.
The second is again access to the garages.
It has already been mentioned, but every time we are arriving or leaving with all our luggage, if we take advantage of the travel service, we have to cope with these colossal stairs.
This is really hard with all your suitcases and papers.
It is inadequate.
I request that this be put to an end.
The third point is the multiplicity of different cards.
I have kept asking, whether it is not technically possible these days to have a single electronic card for everything.
I do not know if you have noticed that the card which opens the garage has to be used the other way round to Brussels.
That means you have to take the thing out every time, then you lose it and so on and so forth, because it gets dropped.
These things are just unacceptable.
I maintain that modern technology is such that these things can be combined into a single item.
Then we wouldn 't have to carry around three, four or five different cards.
Please look into this once more.
