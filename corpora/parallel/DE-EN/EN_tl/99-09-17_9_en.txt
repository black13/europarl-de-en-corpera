Madam President, I too have a request, to thank the city of Strasbourg and the French government for making this building available to us.
For, in spite of the teething troubles, which are perfectly natural, it is a wonderful building and a worthy setting for the European Parliament here in Strasbourg.
I would also like to thank you, Madam President, for taking the initiative in helping to cope with these teething troubles.
I would like to mention one problem, one I hope is not mine alone.
This is the limited number of exits from, and entrances into, this Chamber.
You are familiar with the behaviour of the Members of Parliament.
Generally, we all leave the chamber together or all enter it together before votes.
We keep getting queues of people in the aisles.
This is related to the fact that two access points are simply too few for the large number of Members of Parliament.
I do not know whether it is technically possible to additionally open one of these privileged access points for the Members of Parliament.
There is also a problem in that both the main exits lead to the foyer, which is extremely narrow.
The bridges are there.
The cameras are waiting there.
We Members of Parliament are also, by nature, very undisciplined and chat in the aisle, or stand right in front of the exits and talk to each other.
We could certainly also improve our discipline.
But I think we should have thought of something to make better use of the broad foyers located at the sides of this Chamber.
If we should come out there, we ought also to have the opportunity to sit down together somewhere other than in this enormous telephone kiosk.
I think serious precautions should be taken in the interests of safety, for what if an alarm were to go off?
