Commissioner, thank you for this very clear answer.
I am pleased to see you here for the first time in your new role.
I would just like to ask two questions.
Firstly, is there also concentrated collaboration with the Slovakian universities, especially as regards academic and student exchange?
This is also a question of the expansion of our programme to the associated States.
That is what we have the Additional Protocols for.
Secondly, I would like to ask whether you consider it conceivable that in Helsinki, Slovakia will be ranked among the countries with which discussions are to be held?
