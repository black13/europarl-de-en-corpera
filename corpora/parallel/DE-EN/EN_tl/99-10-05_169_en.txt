Mr Posselt, I can answer the second question easily.
I consider it not only conceivable but I can even tell you right now that I shall be making that proposal at all events and I expect that the Commission will support this proposal.
It is quite clear that the reason that Slovakia has not yet been included in talks is because there were political deficits.
These political deficits have been eliminated, and no one - either in Slovakia or outside it - would understand, if there were not now a suitably positive response from the European Union.
As regards the question about universities, I shall accept that as a suggestion.
On the spur of the moment, I cannot just tell you what concrete collaboration with universities and student exchange there may be.
If they do exist I shall notify you in writing; if they do not exist, I shall put it as a suggestion to the competent authorities.
