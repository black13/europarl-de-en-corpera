Commissioner, I would like to ask a question on the economic situation.
In Slovakia, the package of economy measures has entailed some problems and privations for the population.
It is therefore important to stabilise the economic situation.
We know in Europe small and medium-sized businesses are the bedrock of the economy.
What do you intend to do to expedite economic stability here and especially to establish contact between neighbouring States, located in direct proximity to the European Union?
What programmes are envisaged here to get privatisation on the right road too?
You know, there were considerable problems with the Meciar Government when privatisation went ahead.
I believe that there is a great need for economic rehabilitation, and I believe it is extremely important for Slovakia.
I would like to thank you expressly for the fact that you are going to propose that the appropriate negotiations begin in Helsinki.
I believe this is a very important contribution that Europe can make.
