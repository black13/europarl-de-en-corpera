Mr RÃ¼big, I can only agree with everything you have said.
In Slovakia, it is absolutely essential to quickly work off the deficits which have arisen in recent years.
One of these deficits is the sluggish progress of the privatisation process, which was also connected with other problems, as you well know.
The result is, of course, that we still do not have a satisfactory situation with regard to a self-supporting sector of the economy, capable of development, above all in the middle range.
The Accession Partnership currently under discussion with Slovakia will include appropriate programmes in this area.
The resources already envisaged for Slovakia will indeed serve, as you know, the development of infrastructure or "institution building" , but they can also be implemented as instruments for the regulation and further development of the economy.
We shall do that through the programme.
I cannot give any further details at the moment because, naturally, the basic prior political conditions for that must be achieved first.
Obviously, I shall keep Parliament informed regarding the concrete programmes not just with Slovakia but with other States, for which Accession Partnerships are now being further developed.
