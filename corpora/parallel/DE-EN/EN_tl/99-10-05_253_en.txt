Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe I can answer this question very briefly.
At its meeting on 18 September, the Commission decided the guidelines for the re-organisation of its departments.
This was previously announced - on 9 July - by President Prodi.
According to these guidelines, the Directorate-General for fisheries was furthermore set up.
Thus this decision is also in accord with the explanation which I gave in my hearing to the European Parliament Committee on Fisheries on 30 October.
Over and above that, the organisational plan for the Directorate-General for Fisheries was adopted by the Commission on 29 September.
There is therefore also a valid organisation chart for this Directorate-General.
Finally, at the same meeting, a new director-general for the Directorate-General for Fisheries was also decided, and so it is Mr Smidt who will, in future, be the director-general in charge of the Directorate-General for Fisheries.
This, I hope, clearly establishes that the Directorate-General for Fisheries does exist.
