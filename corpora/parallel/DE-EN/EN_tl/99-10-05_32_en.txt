Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, agricultural production of the conventional kind uses more and more chemical substances, additives, auxiliary substances, antibiotics and hormones - I could go on - and our food processing plants resemble chemical factories rather than food production facilities.
In this situation, supervision at the final stage and the setting of upper limits are no longer adequate measures.
What matters is that we have supervision over the process as a whole.
Interestingly enough, supervision of the process as a whole is laid down in the order concerning conventional, organic farming.
So, in an area where production holds no dangers, we have supervision of the process as a whole, and quite rightly too.
I support that as well.
In the other areas, however, we do not have such controls.
This kind of final-stage supervision is a direct invitation to criminal wheelings and dealings.
Meanwhile, opportunities are taken to blend substances, something which - we must suppose - has led to the systematic addition of toxic substances in the field of feedingstuffs.
This must be changed.
The second point I should like to address is the need to restore the close relationship between producer and consumer.
There is no place for anonymity.
I tell you that if I were to behave on my farm in the way that much of industry, including the food industry, does, people would not come back; or, if they did, it would be with a stick in order to teach me a lesson!
Then I would have no more customers.
This close relationship between producer and consumer, together with responsibility on the part of the consumer for his or her own behaviour, must be restored.
