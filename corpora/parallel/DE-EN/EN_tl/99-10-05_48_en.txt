Madam President, from some of the contributions, you would get the impression that all foods are rubbish and constitute a danger.
That is, of course, as false as if one were to maintain that everything is in order.
That is just the first thing I want to say.
In fact, the dioxin crisis was necessary in order to ensure that a number of the Commission' s and the Member States' shortcomings arising out of the BSE crisis might finally be sorted out.
I am talking about the positive list and the question of open declaration.
But the question of how, in future, we are to handle the issue of meat and bone meal in terms of an effective recycling system still remains.
In this connection, it is of course remarkable if, on the subject of labelling, the Member States and also the Commission consider postponing the identification of cattle and the labelling of meat until after 1 January 2000.
They would not be able to explain the fact to anyone outside.
There must be clarity about what is going to happen.
Mr Prodi, an agency is naturally no substitute for a policy, and there can be no question of our seeing a proliferation in the number of agencies, for then there would come a point when we no longer needed the Commission!
You cannot, however, go and create agencies where things might become difficult for you in order to evade some of the responsibility and then say, in cases where you can in fact exercise power (as with cartel law): we are doing this as the Commission!
These things do not go together.
As always, discussions are therefore required.
I believe that we need a rapid alert system and that the Commission must be entitled to intervene in the Member States more quickly than has so far been the case.
Also relevant in this connection is a framework Directive on Foodstuffs which is worthy of the name and which, in providing preventative protection to the consumer, is easy to read, workable and can be overseen.
(Applause)
