Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee agrees with Mrs Pack' s remarks.
The Council' s decision is also not anticipated for this week, so that no delay is to be expected.
What is more, neither the Committee nor Parliament has yet received an official response from the Council to our representations.
For this reason, I would ask that the request for urgent debate be rejected.
(Parliament rejected the request for urgent procedure)
