Mr President, Commissioner, I have prepared a speech which essentially repeats what the previous speaker said.
I am, unfortunately, in the sad position of having to read out to you a message from Reuters news agency which proves the importance of what we are talking about here.
The message was issued at 3.07 p.m., less than 30 minutes ago.
It reads: Seoul, 22 injured in accident in South Korean nuclear power station.
The precise text reads: 22 workers have been injured in an accident in a South Korean nuclear power station.
They were exposed to radioactive radiation when heavy water escaped.
This was reported today by the Yonhap news agency.
