Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the process of enlargement of the European Union is the important theme of this legislature.
Now today, in an isolated fashion, we have discussed and voted on a resolution on Turkey.
Against the background of this enlargement process, I voted against this resolution.
Today Turkey, and tomorrow perhaps another country too?
The question must be asked.
I consider it important for this Parliament to stop and think fundamentally about how we actually see Europe.
How large should the European Union become?
Today Turkey, tomorrow Armenia, and the next day Morocco, or is there an alternative concept?
I am therefore opposed to extending the established enlargement process now to just any other country.
My second comment is that in Helsinki the Council will very probably include Turkey in the group of candidates for accession.
We have told the eleven countries - the applicant States - that when we accord a country candidate status, we are, at the same time, undertaking to allow their accession to the EU.
That being the case, this status would be devalued by our according it Turkey now, but declaring at the same time that no negotiations are to take place.
This is harmful to the process which has been initiated and I do not consider it acceptable.
I believe that the Parliament has the task here of clarifying what the concept of Europe, which we can finally also call political Union, should be.
