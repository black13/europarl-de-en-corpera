Mr President, Commissioner, in the short time I have left, I would just like to make a few key points.
What do we need to do in terms of form?
We must change the process for the settlement of disputes within the World Trade Organisation.
We must make it more transparent, clearer and more accessible to the public.
This is one of the most important conditions necessary for ensuring that areas such as the protection of the environment and of the consumer are given their rightful place, and are not ridden roughshod over in some panel.
Concerning the areas that are included, Mr Lamy, the most important of all is the precautionary principle.
I have already said this on many occasions.
We must take the precautionary principle from the trade agreement on plant health and apply it to the Agreement.
So what then do we really need?
We need policies on the environment and health to be important and proper components of the Agreement.
The achievements of the World Trade Organisation' s committee on trade and the environment are not enough.
It has not so far fulfilled its duties and must be penalised.
It must be given a clear timetable so that it can give support to the various projects.
What are the most important areas that we really have to deal with?
We must do what the Commission itself asks.
We must make the whole World Trade Organisation more open, more democratic and more transparent and we must ensure that the whole contract underlying it can be subjected, as you yourself say, to a study on its environmental acceptability.
We must examine production methods that are not tied to products and we must have an overview of the situation.
I am convinced that this Parliament will not ratify another agreement in which the precautionary principle, consumer protection and health policies do not play an important part.
