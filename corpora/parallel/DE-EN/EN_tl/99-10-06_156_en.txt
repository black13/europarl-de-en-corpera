Mr President, even if the European Community is a passionate advocate of the new round of negotiations within the framework of the WTO, in the course of what will probably be the last big push for liberalisation, we should not ignore social issues.
Participation in prosperity, a healthy environment and healthy working conditions are by far the best investments for a good future.
Following the 1994 Uruguay Round, we expected to see greater prosperity through higher growth for the ACP countries.
Growth was to a large extent achieved, but according to studies by the OECD and the UNCTAD, standards of living at the lowest levels have not changed at all.
In fact, what has happened is quite the opposite!
It cannot make sense to have a policy of increasing our prosperity while making poor people poorer.
This is why we should not miss the last chance to demand that the seven most important core employment standards, which were ratified in the IAO agreement, be made checkable social clauses.
This does not imply a new form of protectionism, but is to do with standards of fundamental rights with which employees suffering discrimination can protect themselves.
This is a human rights issue and we must strive for this minimum standard.
Once we have these things, we can offer the ACP countries positive incentives to do the same.
There is a whole raft of ideas on this in the Commission' s report.
If we do not succeed in having the social components included, the last great step in achieving liberalisation will not work.
I expect greater commitment on the part of the Council on this matter.
