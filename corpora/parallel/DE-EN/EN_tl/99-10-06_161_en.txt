Mr President, production in the European Union has grown by just over 3% per year in the last few years.
Trade in recent decades has decreased by an average of 6% per year, service exports stand at 9% and foreign direct investments are at about 12%.
This shows very clearly what our priorities must be.
Our number one aim, which is full employment in Europe, requires an improvement in our competitiveness and is being decisively formed by these developments.
My priorities for the WTO negotiations are firstly, electronic commerce, the area with the greatest potential growth rate, and in which Europe is actually very competitive.
In this area, we want to see electronic transactions and supplies made officially exempt from duty in the long term.
We want to avoid ways of looking at the situation that differentiate between traditional and new services as the way in which a transfer of goods or services is effected does not change the nature of providing a service.
We also want improved access to markets in non-EU countries for goods and services, and in the telecommunications services which give the necessary support to electronic commerce.
Secondly, telecommunications.
Well-developed networks and fairer competition have a generally positive effect on a country' s economic performance and employment situation.
The forging of international alliances opens up new markets, and as a consequence brings about a covert and strengthened sense of competition which is to the consumer' s advantage.
But there is also a need for transparency in this area.
Liberalisation is a prime example of a job creator.
Through liberalisation, hundreds of thousands of new and supplementary jobs have been created.
My third point is TRIPs.
The effective implementation of this agreement should safeguard the equality of status between material and intellectual property.
