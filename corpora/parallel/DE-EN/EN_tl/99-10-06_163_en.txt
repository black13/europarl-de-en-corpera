Mr President, the significance of the Millennium Round and world trade on economic and employment policies and for the European economy in general, which is now the largest trading partner in the world, cannot be emphasised enough.
This means that it is particularly important that the European Union clearly states its opposition to any attempt to promote a new or even an old kind of protectionism.
It must contribute towards developing a type of administrative interdependence for interdependent national economies, and it must also contribute to a global concept of economic management.
The most important thing we need to do is to establish international rules for competition.
These rules for competition are all the more important because it is actually not very useful for the development of the European economy to have rules for competition here which do not apply throughout the world.
I am thinking here of huge mergers, amalgamations, price cartels and cartels within a particular field.
It is not acceptable that the 100 biggest companies in the world share things out between themselves, and all we can do about it is react but not actually play a role in it.
That is why we need a catalogue of minimum standards for international rules for competition which must be laid down in national rules for competition.
What we need above all are independent competition authorities in all the countries that are members of the WTO to implement these minimum standards for competition regulations.
Whether a procedure for the arbitration of disputes will one day turn into an international competition authority is a question that should be left open for today.
