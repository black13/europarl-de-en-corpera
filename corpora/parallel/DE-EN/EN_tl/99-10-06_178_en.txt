Mr President, we must be perfectly clear about the scale of all this.
We are currently releasing as much CO2 per day as has been bound in the last 3000 years.
If we add that up over the course of a year, we are actually moving backwards in one go, at a rate of one million years per year.
In this sense, the plans of the Council and the Commission do not of course go far enough by any means and are actually merely cosmetic actions.
What we need in the long term are not voluntary agreements, but thorough analyses of the real costs and to make the whole tax system environmentally friendly.
If these things are not done, it simply will not work!
Within the framework of the current agreement on the common position, the requirement in Amendment No 5, that is, an EU Directive with legally binding targets for renewable energies to be achieved, is the minimum condition necessary if the Paper in any form can be taken seriously to any great extent.
