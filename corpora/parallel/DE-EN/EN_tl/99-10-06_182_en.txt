Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I think that what the public expects from us is not a contribution to even more hot air, but concrete measures.
The most important of these will be specific steps towards the incorporation of them by the European Union, and industry-specific targets and timetables.
Unfortunately, I have heard you say very little about these things here today.
Please be more specific.
I believe that we must start implementation here in the EU and not wait until the start of the period of enforcement.
There are two other points I would like to mention.
Commissioner, you mentioned renewable energy sources.
This is less a matter of financial assistance and more of when we will have a European "feed-in directive" with compensation that actually covers the costs.
Secondly, as the Swedish speaker already said, there is the matter of taxing aviation fuel.
According to our international obligations, we are not able to tax aviation fuel.
What is possible, though, is a tax on CO2.
The European Union could introduce such a tax immediately.
I would have liked to hear in concrete terms, what the timetables look like and how they stand in relation to these two specific recommendations, which represent a real contribution to achieving a noticeable fall in CO2 emissions.
