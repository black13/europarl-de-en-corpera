Mr President, firstly I would like to thank Mrs Laura González Álvarez and also the Spanish speaker who is coming after me.
Without them, one might have assumed that this is a Northern European debate.
This is not the case, as this is an issue which concerns us all.
On climate change itself, I would like to express my fear that this issue is being continually pushed into the background, as something which is of less and less interest to the public and to politicians.
Finally we have professed our beliefs and that appears to be enough for most people.
That would be extraordinarily dangerous!
Therefore, I would like to suggest two things: firstly, we should endorse Mr Lange' s call to reach agreement on the emissions trade with the close involvement of Parliament, because such a powerful intervention in trade policy would be very difficult to carry out against Parliament' s wishes.
Secondly, I suggest that we establish a binding timetable, one with real sanctions against any EU State that deviates from the targets for reduction.
The model I recommend is the concerted reduction of debt, which has now made the Euro possible.
