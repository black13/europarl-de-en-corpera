Mr President, now that we have discussed the question of world-wide negotiations in great detail, of course we have to optimise our own strategy.
I am pleased then, that the Commissioner finally wants to propose appropriate strategies.
At the moment, I rather have the feeling that our actions are relatively selective and ad hoc and not really purposeful.
What we really need is an integrated strategy on which we will base our decision as to which industry-specific measures we should take.
I would like to come back to the idea of voluntary agreements.
The gist of the Commission' s statement is that we should call on everyone to sign up to voluntary agreements.
This will not allow us to state precisely where our priorities lie and what conditions are necessary to achieve them.
I reiterate Parliament' s continual demand to specify what measures are required for each industry and how they should be applied.
