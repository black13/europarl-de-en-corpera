Mr President, some of the speakers have already asked quite specific questions.
I would like to ask Mrs Wallstr√∂m again, to go into some specific details.
Firstly, there was the question on when we can expect industry-specific plans for reduction, and timetables for this from the Commission.
Secondly, there was the question raised by two of us on the subject of CO2 emissions from aviation fuel.
The question obviously still remains as to how you produce a Directive on phasing in renewable energies, and providing compensation which actually covers the costs.
I would be most grateful to you if you could answer these three specific points.
I do not know if you are in a position to as you have so recently taken up your post.
I think that we are agreed that we should all do something to protect the environment.
