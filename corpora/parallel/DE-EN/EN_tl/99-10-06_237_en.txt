Mr President, we must, of course, adopt a tough and determined line on violence and crime.
We are all aware that that there are constantly muggings in Brussels, within sight of this Parliament, and that out there, crime is the order of the day.
There are really no comparative statistics for Europe.
If you ask EUROSTAT, they give extremely varied results.
I think that we need standards for evaluating crime and that we need comparable statistics.
During the last legislature I asked the Council to make an effort to look after the safety of Parliament' s employees and of the people of Brussels.
I would also like to take this opportunity to request the Council to create a safety initiative which is for Brussels and against crime in the city.
