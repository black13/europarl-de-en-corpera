Mr President, the chairman of the Group of the European People' s Party expressed his sympathy with regard to my own group, because at the time we made heavy weather of the decision on Customs Union.
I would like to return this sympathy on the grounds of the ease, with which the Group of the European People' s Party has undergone a complete U-turn in its position since the agreement on Customs Union.
Mr President, I have listened attentively to what the President of the Council and also Commissioner Verheugen have said on the subject of the possible candidacy of Turkey in Helsinki.
I would have welcomed it if it really had been an honourable position of the European Union with regard to Turkey.
But I am afraid that we are re-establishing a policy which, for decades, has permitted us to hide behind the Greeks and say that the Greeks would never agree to it.
Now, as the Greeks are showing that they would agree under certain circumstances, we must, in fact, come clean.
We must really ask ourselves in all conscience if we want to have Turkey in the European Union or not.
Nuances of wording, whether it concerns one candidate for one candidacy, as in this case, or whether we should establish a new category of candidates, who are indeed valid candidates but with whom no negotiations are held, will by no means be beneficial to our relationship with Turkey.
My last remark concerns a matter in which nuances of wording once again play a role.
We are always talking about the Kurdish question, but we never talk about the Kurdish people.
This is a people of between 12 and 20 million individuals, who nowhere, either in Turkey or in other countries, can enjoy their freedoms, human rights and rights as citizens.
We must support the cause of these people.
