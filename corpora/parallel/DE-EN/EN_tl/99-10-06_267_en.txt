Mr President, I am referring directly to a discussion with Mr Verheugen in Questions to Council before the European elections, and I would like to say that, of course, Croatia has many things to improve on.
But many people who were driven out have now returned, and democracy there is very highly developed.
Therefore, I would like to ask you why Russia is receiving a TACIS programme as is the Ukraine, and why States like Albania which have many problems also have a Agreement on Trade and Cooperation.
Why are tougher criteria imposed on Croatia - and I am afraid that this does appear to be the case - than on any other country?
The PHARE programme and the Agreement on Trade and Cooperation are the first steps in taking a country forwards in order to reform and open it up.
My question is: do you not want to take this step at last?
