Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think the premise, which is repeated again and again here, according to which Turkey would have to fulfil specific conditions to become a Member of the European Union, is a false one.
Just imagine if the Turks were actually to fulfil the criteria!
We, in the European Union would be in no position whatsoever to integrate Turkey.
That is the reality!
For we have a principle in this European Union of ours, the socialist principle of redistribution of wealth from the rich to the poor.
We call it economic and social cohesion.
If Turkey were to become a Member of the European Union, then of course Turkey would also have a claim in having this principle respected.
The European Union would be completely overtaxed by this.
What we are planning now, is already a show of strength of the first order, i.e. integrating the Poles, the Czechs and Hungary, whom I would have in the European Union tomorrow rather than the day after.
But we cannot yet integrate Turkey too.
And as regards identity, as this is an argument which keeps being brought into play, I think that if Turkey is European, then Ukraine and Russia, at least, should first belong to the European Union, and that is impossible too.
But it is equally impossible to integrate Turkey.
We should dismiss this thought.
We should not string Turkey along any longer.
It is just unfair and thoughtless.
It is not we but our children who will have to pay the price.
