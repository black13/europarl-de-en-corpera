Mr President, as Europeans, we have a special, historic responsibility in connection with the peace process in the Near East.
This responsibility cannot however involve our judging the current political strategy or the Palestinians and expressing our opinions on democratically elected politicians in Israel.
As Europeans, we must remain neutral in this conflict and support both sides equally in their efforts.
We are therefore, like the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance rejecting motions for resolutions which express views which are increasingly critical of the Israeli Government but which do not go into the problems of the other side.
As Europeans we cannot afford to take sides in this conflict, thus losing our credibility as negotiators.
