Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I welcome the fact that, according to your statement, there is again movement in the peace process.
Nonetheless I would like to stress that the terms of the present agreement fall considerably short of those of the Wye Agreement.
I am disappointed by these repeated relapses to agreements already signed.
It is so much more gratifying that the Commission is taking the political initiative in supporting the Gaza seaport, the connection between the West bank and the Gaza strip and the "People-to-People" projects.
I consider the working party on regional cooperation important in taking forward the multilateral negotiations of the Madrid Process.
As Greens, we are requesting a Council and Commission Initiative on the disarmament process in particular and on environmental protection.
We ask Israel to make the joint use and fair sharing of resources with Palestine possible, especially in the area of ground water and drinking water supplies.
The peace process between Israel and Syria requires stronger support from the EU.
The situation must not be allowed to deteriorate into a two-way blockade!
