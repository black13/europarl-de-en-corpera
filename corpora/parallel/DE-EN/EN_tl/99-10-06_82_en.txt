Madam President, I have to comment on the same thing.
It is very, very misleading, as obviously most Members have mentioned, in paragraph 1, and that is the most important paragraph of all.
The printed text reads: voting on the first section, second and third section.
This is misleading insofar as in this sentence both the "first" and the "second section" refer to the first half of this rather long paragraph.
The difference between the "Vote, first section" and the "Vote, second section" is only that the words "to apply" should be added in the one instance and omitted in the other.
If the words "to apply" are missing, then this of course completely changes the meaning of the sentence, because it then reads as if Turkey is in fact eligible for membership.
If "to apply" remains, then it is saying that Turkey has the right to apply for membership.
This is the "first section" in plain language.
Anyone voting in favour of the first section will want to remove the words.
Anyone voting against where it says here in the text "first section" will want to have the words "to apply" included in the second section.
I therefore request, Madam President, that exceptionally in this case you should read out what we are voting on so that everyone is clear as to what they are voting on.
