Madam President, I will not hold you up long.
It is patently obvious that in such an important matter you do not need us to advise you to please read the individual points out first.

...I do not know about the Austrians, but, since the Group of the European People' s Party is backing out, we naturally thought about whether we should have the vote today.
I am however in favour of giving the Commission and Council an orientation decision today by means of our vote, as to the direction they should move in.
I would only ask, Madam President, that we may have a separate vote on paragraph 7, because I have an oral amendment on it.
I shall come back to this later.
