Thank you, Mrs Schroedter.
We could really sense your own personal commitment.
I would like to call Mr Sacr√©deus as the next speaker.
Perhaps you can help us a little with the correct pronunciation of your name.
It is certainly a name with holy connotations and you are from Sweden.
Perhaps you could tell us how it should be pronounced.
