Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is certainly not the first time that this House has talked about a war in Chechnya, nor is it the first time that we have talked about a problem in the Caucasus.
Mind you, compared with the war that took place in 1995, the motives behind this war are much more understandable.
The events which have taken place in Dagestan and Chechnya in recent weeks render it almost imperative that this pressing problem be resolved through military action.
The problem in the Caucasus, in Chechnya, Dagestan and Ingushetia is actually nothing new.
It has been around for decades, for centuries, and it is therefore also quite important that in our resolution, we express the view that in general in this area, the problem has to be tackled and a solution has to be sought, something which is important for the region as a whole and which will bring stability to the entire region as well as contribute to its development.
The proposal in the resolution to convene a New Millennium Conference in which European partners and organisations would also participate and provide structures for such negotiations is, therefore, very important.
I hope that our Russian negotiating partners will take this up accordingly.
The European Union also has to look into the problem of refugees, and very closely at that.
Hundreds of thousands are again fleeing.
We still have things to do as regards the refugee problem from previous conflicts.
I would like to call upon the Commission to make proposals as quickly as possible in this regard as to how the problem can be solved; how a way can be found for the refugees to survive the winter, which is imminent.
I think that being able to help in this area is a matter of the deepest concern for Europe.
