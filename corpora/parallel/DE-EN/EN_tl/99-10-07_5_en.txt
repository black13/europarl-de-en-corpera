Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, once more we have a war.
In this motion, this term, unfortunately, does not appear and therefore, I am pleased that Mrs Krehl used this expression.
Do you also not consider it appalling and alarming that both in thought and deed, responsible politicians regard the use of military violence as an indispensable element in the resolution of conflicts?
And do you also not consider it appalling and alarming that increasingly, the inhumane tactic of bombardment, which was employed to excess in Yugoslavia and where nobody suffered more than the civilian population, is again regarded, in the meantime, as being an adequate policy?
Mrs Krehl, I simply cannot understand you when you talk about fighting terror with terror, and when you express understanding for the current situation in Russia.
Military violence has no place in the political spectrum in the resolution of conflicts.
