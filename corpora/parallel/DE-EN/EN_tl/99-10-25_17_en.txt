Madam President, I am sorry, but I was getting Tuesday and Wednesday confused.
I would be most grateful if you could advise me whether it would be possible for the Council, before the vote on the report on Kosovo - which we have urged should take place - to at last provide its comments on Parliament' s amendments, following which we will then be able to hold the final vote.
We had made a written request for the Council to be present, for it to comment and for us to hold the vote only after this has been done.
Has it now been resolved that this is how matters are to be handled?
