Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the decision on the establishment of an anti-fraud office can largely be attributed to the European Parliament' s involvement.
The establishment of this office was a very significant decision because combating fraud plays a central role in the way the citizens of our Member States perceive European politics.
This is why the general public expects this office to be able to perform its task thoroughly, and this ability to perform its task thoroughly will relate primarily to the institutions in which OLAF is able to carry out investigations, and I therefore welcome Mr Napolitano' s report and the contributions that have been made here.
The appointment of the director will obviously play a major role in the office' s ability to do its job.
A special appointment procedure was agreed on and has been emphasised here several times.
That is why it is also necessary to prevent irregularities in this procedure.
I can assure you, ladies and gentlemen, and you, Mr BÃ¶sch, that I, for my part, will prevent any improper influence being exerted on the selection of a director.
The only decisive factor in appointing someone to this extremely important post should be that person' s qualifications for the job.
I hope that very soon the selection of the candidates and the appointment of a director will take place, through consensus, and also that the posts you have already approved for this year will soon be filled.
I can assure you that the Commission is fully aware of the role that combating fraud plays in the way European politics are perceived by our citizens and therefore, on behalf of the Commission, I once again welcome the report and the work that went into it.
