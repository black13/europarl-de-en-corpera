Mr President, I will not take up the two full minutes because several thoughts that I wanted to express, particularly about road safety, have already been expressed by the preceding speakers.
I think that the problem of road safety, particularly for two-wheel motor vehicles, is actually a problem that concerns the younger generation above all.
I personally only ride motorcycles and never drive a car.
I am also a member of various motorcycle clubs and deal with young people there too.
This is why I think it is particularly necessary to do something about this specific area.
Of course, speedometers are installed in order to automatically create an inhibiting threshold to the vehicle' s speed because otherwise - unfortunately this is the case - very high speeds are attained which these vehicles cannot cope with on account of their centre of gravity being too high, for example.
This has dire consequences.
For this reason, we fully endorse this directive, and we would also be pleased, of course, if, all in all, more could be done in the European Parliament with regard to road safety so that it is more consistent between Member States, because the accident figures clearly show that young people are the ones most affected in this area.
We agree that the deadline should be postponed.
We must also give industry the chance to actually transpose it if, at the end of the day, that then helps us to achieve a uniform directive.
We also believe that an advisory committee would be the appropriate instrument for this.
