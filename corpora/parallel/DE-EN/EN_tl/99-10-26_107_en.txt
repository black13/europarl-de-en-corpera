Mr President, I have a question for Mr Nielson regarding bridging the gap which he mentioned.
He said there would be further discussion of this.
Were there any proposals in the expert report as to the form this involvement of development aid would take or even of other development instruments such as PHARE or TACIS, for example, and has it been ascertained whether the problems are in the area of ecological aid and the programme there or in the area of other forms of aid?
Could you clarify this?
