Mr President, with all due respect to the rapporteurs, the Committee on Budgets will not take seriously the fact that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market is applauding it for its work!
The Committee on Budgets has let down the European Court of Justice, as has the Council!
I know that in the political process law is frequently considered irritating.
However, to disregard in such a way the work of the European Court of Justice on European integration and legal protection of the individual is verging on scandalous!
The question arises as to what role a specialised committee should continue to play when the Committee on Budgets, in a generous gesture, simply sweeps all the carefully considered, moderate proposals from the table?
So what role should specialised committees continue to play?
I fear that legal protection in this European Union will continue to be limited.
It is all too clear who is responsible for this.
We should not expose ourselves to the danger of limiting legal protection in the European Union, not least when we constantly talk of wanting to create an area of freedom, security and justice.
