Commissioner, Mr President, the current climate conference in Bonn is crying out for more funds for renewable energies; to wit funds from the EU, both for research and for demonstration projects.
The recent nuclear accidents in Japan and South Korea again show how overdue a new energy policy is.
Regarding the EURATOM credits, we in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy are asking that Parliament be consulted immediately.
It is incomprehensible to us that our colleagues in the Committee on Budgets cannot support this as parliamentarians.
The sole purpose of the budget lines in the area of trade is, professedly, to promote exports and create free market access.
Yet this so-called "free market" only exists for multinational concerns because, for example, the SME cannot access either the information on money allocation nor the programmes themselves.
In the last two decades exports from Latin America have increased by 300% whilst the gross domestic product in those countries has only increased by 3.3%.
Since the beginning of the worldwide policy of a liberalised world economic area, there has been a massive redistribution from the rich to the poor, both within societies and between States.
I advocate the opposite political trend.
The result is that the financial assistance from the EU is indirect subsidisation.
It is precisely this which contradicts the declared concept of free trade.
Ultimately, what we are seeing here is another of the many inherent contradictions in WTO policy.
