Mr President, any budget reflects the financial implementation of the intended policy.
Consequently, the decision to accept or reject the budget can, of course, only be bound up with how the focal points of the policy match up to one' s own ideas and whether the available financial funds are sufficient.
What then, in my opinion, are the main criteria for this budget?
Firstly, a drastic minimisation of the unemployment which dominates in the Member States of the European Union.
Secondly, a reduction in the economic and social divergences in the Member States.
Thirdly, the enlargement of the European Union and, fourthly, a peaceful, democratic and social development of all regions in the world.
If, and this I am assuming, you share these starting points, albeit there will certainly be differences of opinions as to the ways in which we reach these goals, it must be clear that the budget, as it stands, cannot be affirmed.
Mrs Schreyer, I am, of course, in favour of reorganising and redistributing.
I would immediately switch the focus from large enterprise to small and medium-sized economic policy which safeguards jobs.
I would immediately move from an offer-oriented economic policy to a demand-oriented economic policy in order to boost consumption.
But it is absurd to find ever more responsibilities for the European Union without providing it with the necessary financial funds.
It cannot be the duty of Parliament to accept that the Council wants to finance important new political needs by renouncing traditional needs.
Similarly, it cannot be the duty of this Parliament to accept that the Member States want to reorganise their budgets to the detriment of the European Union budget.
Consequently, I consider that the most urgent task, given that we have a new Parliament and a new Commission, is to give consideration to the fact that the Financial Perspective really must be amended and that the interinstitutional agreement must also be modified.
