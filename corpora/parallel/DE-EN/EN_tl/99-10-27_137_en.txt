Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Patten, I should like to use the term which President Clinton used to characterise the behaviour of the Senate.
He called this irresponsible.
This irresponsibility has dealt a severe blow to all international efforts towards non-proliferation and puts nuclear disarmament into a state of severe crisis.
It seems that much more important to me at this time for the EU to take the initiative in this area.
I welcome the initiative of President Jacques Chirac, Chancellor Gerhard Schr√∂der and Prime Minister Tony Blair who, in an open letter to the American public, canvassed in favour of ratifying the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
That was not enough.
We know that.
Therefore, we must do a lot more.
We must think in concrete terms and we must take action.
I am a little disappointed, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that you have only told us what we have read in the newspapers anyway.
I congratulate Commissioner Patten on the very concrete steps which he has presented here.
Commissioner, I should like to urge you to collate these steps in a kind of action catalogue forming part of a report for the European Parliament.
In that way, we can become active, take initiatives or make further proposals to the Council.
I should finally again like to support what the European Parliament decided on 18 November of last year when it supported the eight States' declarations of 9 June 1998 concerning the new agenda coalition for the rapid, definitive and complete elimination of nuclear weapons.
Demand this, and the European Parliament ought to renew its support.
