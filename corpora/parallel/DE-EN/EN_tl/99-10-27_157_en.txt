Mr President, Commissioner, there is no doubt that constructive cooperation between Russia and the CIS States, on the one hand, and Europe on the other, is one of the most important prerequisites for peace for the 21st century.
Cooperation of this kind is presently threatened by the war in Chechnya and by other regional conflicts.
I believe, however, that the war in Chechnya should not be seen either as a purely regional conflict or as a purely religious dispute.
That would be to play down the situation and also to underestimate it.
It is also quite clearly a question of geo-strategical manoeuvrings for access to the oil and gas reserves in the Caucasus and around the Caspian Sea.
Here, European, American, Chinese, Russian and other economic interests collide.
A small spark in this area can lead to an explosion.
And, as of today, a new crisis has evolved, namely in Armenia.
A few hours ago, Prime Minister Sarkisjan and President of the Parliament Demirtschjan were murdered.
