Madam President, I can only support what Mr Watson has said in his intervention and make it clear that, despite the poor preparation (since Parliament was genuinely excluded and not kept informed at all by the Finnish Presidency), the outcome is nonetheless welcome.
We in Parliament must also, of course, express our thanks to Commissioner Vitorino, for his contribution was decisive as far as the outcome was concerned.
I think that the Finnish Presidency should learn from this that, when one is prepared to cooperate, one can also achieve reasonable results.
We saw this when the Commission got involved and salvaged a good deal of what there was to be salvaged.
With this in mind - and in view of the fact that my colleague, Mrs Boumediene-Thiery, of my Group has really already said everything that needs to be said - I should just like to add the following comment.
We now have a good outcome.
There are still outstanding questions, and the years 2000 and 2001 will be the decisive years in which a great deal will finally be undertaken.
I hope the future Presidencies of the Council will support the Commission and Parliament and keep us informed.
In that way, we shall, in the end, be able to translate this positive outcome into action.
