Mr President, I can only agree with Mr Lehne.
Cooperation between the European Union and the Russian Federation is of enormous importance, and important matters were discussed at the summit, too.
I really cannot, however, to be honest, share the optimistic account Mr Sasi has just given of present circumstances and future development within the Russian Federation.
When I examine the Joint Declaration of the Summit on Chechnya - the most important matter at the moment in our cooperation with Russia - I see that it says that the European Union and the Russian Federation exchanged viewpoints about the situation in the North Caucasus.
In fact, that really cannot be all there is to say.
Any cooperation with Russia is at present overshadowed by the war in Chechnya.
There are already 180 000 refugees in Ingushetia and Dagestan.
Aid organisations cannot work there.
Thousands of refugees are no longer permitted to leave the country, and the Russian government is not prepared to talk.
We need a political solution.
I am of the view that the European Union must attach more weight to discussions.
We have an interest in cooperating with Russia.
Naturally, we need Russia, for example in Kosovo.
But Russia in turn needs us, that is to say it needs the European Union.
I think that consideration might be given to whether, in negotiations, the following might be said: we must consider whether, if no political solution is sought and found in Chechnya, we ought in fact to block credits or cancel aid - other than forms of humanitarian aid - for Russia.
(Applause)
In the European Parliament, we did not ratify the partnership agreement in the case of the first war in Chechnya.
Now, at a summit which has become significantly more explosive politically, we are still only talking about exchanging opinions.
In its efforts to achieve greater weight for its foreign policy, the European Union should not permit this.
(Applause)
