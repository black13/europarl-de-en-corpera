Mr President, to follow on seamlessly, may I thank you, Constanze Krehl, for finally being so courageous and for saying these things so clearly.
Throughout Europe, this summit has been a gigantic disappointment.
Nor can there really be any beating about the bush as the Presidency has just done.
In fact, the EU has failed downright and has not used the possibilities open to it.
Why are we again accepting a brutal war by Russia against its own people?
Why do we simply pass on to the existing agenda?
That is really not what meetings at the highest level are there for.
They are not there for the purpose of exchanging civilities.
They are there for calling a spade a spade.
I must say that the report by the Finnish Presidency is a mockery of the facts, however they are described.
The truth is that villagers are being bombarded and refugees surrounded, and these are startling infringements of international laws.
This is not just an internal matter for Russia that can simply be brushed aside.
We have the partnership and cooperation agreement, we have the human rights clauses and, therefore, we have the opportunity to threaten economic sanctions and press for the bombardments to cease.
Without this, no international aid can arrive there, Mr Patten; that is no doubt clear.
I therefore expect the Presidency and the Commission to get together now and to develop a strategy in the framework of the Joint Foreign and Security Policy which threatens the use of these economic tools and compels Russia to end this war.
