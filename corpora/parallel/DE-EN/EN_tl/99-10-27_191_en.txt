Mr President, a short comment.
I should like to point out that the English text has been changed.
In amendment 12, a portion of the proposal withdrawn by Mrs Scallon has found its way back into the German version.
Spiritual undertakings ought to be included in the investigation of activities.
This runs the risk of our suddenly also having sects for young people included in the programme.
This part of the amendment had been withdrawn at the Committee stage.
I would ask you to check the language versions for which the English text provides the basis.
