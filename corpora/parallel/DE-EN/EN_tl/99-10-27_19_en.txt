Madam President, we are all still under the spell of the June elections in which a clear, absolute majority was achieved.
But for the low turn-out (with people not voting, either because they were not interested in, or did not agree with, the development of the Union), the election was probably a milestone of democracy.
Whether the conclusions of the Presidency and whether the results of the Tampere Summit will merit the term "milestone" remains to be seen.
By the time of Amsterdam, we had had to acknowledge that the limits had been reached of how far the Member States were prepared to move towards integration.
Following Amsterdam, there was extensive agreement that the Intergovernmental Conference was no longer a suitable instrument of change.
This analysis was impressively confirmed by the embarrassingly low turn-out in the election.
Otherwise, everything is continuing much as before.
True, the Intergovernmental Conference is to get a face-lift, but the basic problems remain the same.
There are doubtless some more positive entries on the balance sheet: the Tampere declarations concerning the area of freedom, security and justice; efforts towards a more intensive programme for combating crime; and improved access to justice.
And also the results we are already seeing of the new policy on asylum and migration.
Where, however, it was a matter of placing common interests before individual ones - for example, when it came to a fair sharing of the load - no agreement could be reached.
Our conclusion, then, about Tampere: no doubt some important steps were taken there, but these were hardly milestones.
