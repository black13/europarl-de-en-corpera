Mr President, we can either accept and rejoice in the outcome of the Tampere Summit or else consider it to be defective.
However we may categorise the result, the Tampere Summit was, and is, important.
It is important because it signifies a step towards a common European area of justice.
The direction is the correct one.
But with the great goal of the common area of justice in front of us, Tampere is just a small step on a long road.
The people of Europe expect more.
They expect larger and, above all, courageous steps in quick succession.
I am convinced that they are also entitled to these.
The citizens of Europe can certainly demand that the law in every individual Member State should offer them the same level of safety, protection and security.
They can expect not to be taken to the cleaners in a neighbouring country with the help of another legal system which is alien to them.
Summits of varying degrees of solemnity do not alone do justice to these entitlements.
Just as peace is not created simply by not going to war, so too is a common European area of justice not created just by a handful of governments expressing their good will.
Reliable rules for cooperation must also follow a willingness to cooperate on issues of justice.
The Council and the governments alone cannot create these.
Parliament must help them.
The Council should know that, in the interests of the people whom we represent as Members of the European Parliament, we are prepared to do this and will in fact do it.
