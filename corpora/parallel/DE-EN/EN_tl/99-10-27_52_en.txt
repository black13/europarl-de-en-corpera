Mr President, I see the report of the Wise Men as being a big step forward and I expressly agree with Commissioner Barnier that comprehensive reform of the European Union must now be implemented and should not be postponed until after the enlargement of the Union.
That would be disastrous and fatal because what the 15 States cannot settle among themselves, 20 or 25 States most certainly will not be able to.
Now is the last chance to reform the Union in such a way that it functions properly, is understood by the citizens and is capable of being expanded.
I am pleased that the Treaties are to be redesigned.
None of our citizens understands the Treaties of Maastricht or of Amsterdam.
It is unreasonable to expect any citizen of the Union to read these texts.
The texts must now successfully be divided up into their genuinely constitutional and their more technical elements.
This distinction needs to be made, as it is in our Member States' own fundamental laws or constitutions.
A word about the reform of the institutions.
The Dehaene Group has concentrated very much upon the reform of the Commission.
In my view, it is the Council which should be at the centre of the reform.
The Commission will function on the basis of what is done now.
Parliament has carried through reforms and is functioning.
The institution which is not functioning is the Council.
It is the Council which forms a barrier within the Union.
In Parliament, we shall therefore also be concentrating on making demands for the reform of the Council.
The rules must somehow be laid down for this dual role it has as both a legislative and an executive body, and certainly in a Union of 20 or 25 Member States.
I hope, Commissioner Barnier, that the Commission can come up with a concrete proposal for altering the Treaty, which we shall then discuss.
