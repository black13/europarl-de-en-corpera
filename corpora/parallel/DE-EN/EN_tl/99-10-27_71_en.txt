Mr President, I should like, because it is not unimportant, to refer to a linguistic ambiguity in Amendment 1 and simply have this put on record.
In clause 2, point 16 of the German version, it says: "Es bedarf keiner gesetzlichen ...
Rahmenbedingungen für Signaturen, die ausschließlich in geschlossenen ..."
The word "geschlossenen" must be taken out.
This is a printing error.
In the same way, further on in the same clause it reads "einer begrenzten Anzahl ..."
Instead of "begrenzt" , it should read "bestimmt" , that is to say "einer bestimmten Anzahl" or, in English, "defined" .
May I also point out that I am asking for Amendment 6 not to be accepted, because otherwise this important directive would not come into force.
