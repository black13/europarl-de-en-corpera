Madam President, at the start of the sitting you not only reported events in Armenia, but also informed us that you would be sending a message to Armenia.
As the president of the delegation for cooperation between the European Union and Armenia, I would like to thank you most sincerely for that.
We are all horrified at the tragic events which occurred last night in the Armenian Parliament.
Not only the head of government, but also the president of the parliament and several other politicians were murdered.
We must ask ourselves whether peaceful development is now possible in Armenia.
The raid has plunged the new Republic of Armenia, located in direct proximity to Chechnya, into a state of emergency, the effects of which cannot yet be predicted.
I think you all share my hope that the recently won independence of Armenia will not thereby be threatened once again.
