Madam President, I echo your regrets, and I also work on the assumption that errors of this type must not recur in future.
I signed the PPE resolution myself and was, naturally, more than astonished, not to say horrified, at the subsequent actions.
At this point in time I also have to say that, unfortunately, this is not the first such occurrence.
I have experienced something similar in the Committee on Budgetary Control.
Something must be done here, immediately and as a matter of urgency.
