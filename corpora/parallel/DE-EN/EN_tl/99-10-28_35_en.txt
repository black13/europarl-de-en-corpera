Madam President, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I would like to thank the coordinators of all Groups in the Committee on Budgets for the fact that this compromise has been achieved.
I must acknowledge the generous nature of the general rapporteur, who was himself of another opinion.
That is understandable, and I also know that the Committee chairman was in favour of another view, but we should pay tribute to the hard work of all the representatives of the Committee on Budgets here.
The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development supports this view.
