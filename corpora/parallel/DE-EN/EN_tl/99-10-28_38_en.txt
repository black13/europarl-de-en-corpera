Madam President, Amendment No 65, introduced by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, has now been included in the compromise amendment in a somewhat altered form, but it has been included, so that plant and animal genetic resources have received their own title.
The Council still has to approve this.
Something in the compromise was deferred so we do not have to vote on it now.
We therefore withdraw our amendment.
