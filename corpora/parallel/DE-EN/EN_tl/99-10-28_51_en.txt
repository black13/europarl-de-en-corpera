Mr President, this is a matter which requires a broad majority, which we hope to ensure.
But in the report, as it now stands before us, there are still some points of uncertainty with reference to two matters.
Firstly, there is no clear definition of members and elected representatives.
This is worth clarifying.
Secondly, there is uncertainty and a procedure, which we consider incorrect, stating that, in the event of errors in Parliament, officials should report back to other officials.
We, on the other hand, are of the opinion that, if there are irregularities, officials must report back to the President of the Parliament.
We must come back to these matters again.
We therefore request that the report be referred back to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs.
The Committee could call an extraordinary meeting in the course of the next week and, if necessary, in Brussels on Thursday of next week we could then finally proceed to the vote, making it possible to gain the broad support of the whole House, if the requisite clarifications have been made.
But, failing this referral to Committee, today unfortunately we are not in a position to give this report our approval, to our great regret.
With the intention of achieving a broad consensus on this important question, we therefore demand that the report be referred back to Committee.
