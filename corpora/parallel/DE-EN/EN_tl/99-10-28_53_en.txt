Mr President, it is not a matter of being obstructive here.
It is not a matter of obstructing the work of OLAF, or not facilitating it.
We all want OLAF to be able to commence its work properly as soon as possible and work effectively for the benefit of the European Union.
But this proposal contains considerable legal weaknesses which require further consultation.
Articles 2 and 4 of the Annex to the Rules of Procedure contain conditions which are clearly in contradiction of the Protocol on Privileges and Immunities, which concern the status of elected representatives and which also, incidentally, lay down the rules governing the question of immunity aside from what is stated in the relevant regulations of the Protocol on Privileges and Immunities.
I am therefore convinced that this needs revising in the interests of the case, and would therefore like to request that we adopt Mr Poettering' s suggestion.
