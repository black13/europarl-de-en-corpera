Mr President, the matter of the Annex to the Rules of Procedure will most certainly be determined by a simple majority.
But the addition of an Annex to the Rules of Procedure is quite clearly an amendment to the actual Rules of Procedure and, as such, requires an absolute majority.
We can never amend the actual Rules of Procedure by means of an Annex.
That is perfectly clear.
We have just decided, may I remind you, that the common regulation contained in the interinstitutional agreement, with the necessary measures to facilitate the trouble-free conduct of OLAF inquiries in accordance with the Parliament resolution, which is appended as an Annex to the Rules of Procedure, is applicable within Parliament.
This resolution did not achieve the necessary majority.
It cannot therefore claim validity on the basis of the Rules of Procedure.
I believe we would be well advised to refer this matter back to the competent committee for consultation now and discontinue the debate on the Rules of Procedure here.
