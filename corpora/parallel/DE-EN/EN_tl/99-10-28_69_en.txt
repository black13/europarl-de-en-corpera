Mr President, I would like to express my thanks to the Commission for responding so quickly to our own quick work.
The principal task, however, still lies ahead of us, namely that of persuading the Council.
The chief problem area can be found in the Budget.
With Parliament' s demands for EUR 980 million, we are now facing a Council proposal of EUR 350 million, and another EUR 490 million in the seven-year programme.
This is the area of the great debate which we face and, against the combined forces of the Commission and Parliament, it is now up to the Council to change.
(Parliament adopted the amended common position)
