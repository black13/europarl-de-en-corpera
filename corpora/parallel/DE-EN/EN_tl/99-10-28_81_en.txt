- The Members of the Austrian Freedom Party will be rejecting both Mr Bourlanges' motion for a resolution (individual plan III - Commission) and Mr Virrankoski' s (further individual plans), since the principles of transparency and efficiency in the budget procedure were not respected.
Nor is it possible to carry out effective supervision of the Union' s budgetary procedure.
Apart from that, the Commission operates far too ponderously.
The processing of applications and payments to the citizens of the Union in some cases takes more than 18 months, leading to justifiable criticism of the administration of the Union.
Insufficient funds and programmes are provided in the Budget 2000 for real problems such as, for example, the high rate of unemployment.
The Union is somewhat helpless in the face of the effects of globalisation and the introduction of the euro.
Instead of developing employment schemes or programmes promoting small and medium-sized enterprises, the Union indulges in an administration which is far too expensive, with two parliament buildings, for instance.
The challenge for the future will be whether the EU can manage to draw up common principles which ensure that an economic recovery returns to Europe through which the problems of the labour market can for the most part, be eliminated.
To this end it will also be necessary, however, for the administrations of the Union and national states to be structured more effectively.
Since it cannot seriously be discerned that the Union can contribute to an economic recovery in Europe, the Budget for 2000 is rejected in its entirety.
