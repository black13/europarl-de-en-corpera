Madam President, I would like to address this point, not because I have followed previous events over the last few days particularly carefully.
I am not such a great expert as the previous speaker or Mr Pronk.
But there is one thing that I would like to stress and make perfectly plain.
This is that agreements which are made, also in the Conference of Presidents, must be respected.
I very clearly remember discussing in the Conference of Presidents, as my neighbours here on the right, Pat Cox, Mrs Hautala, Mr Bar√≥n Crespo and others will recall, whether we should mention Michelin or discuss globalisation and the restructuring of firms in a general way.
The Conference of Presidents came to the unanimous conclusion that we should not discuss Michelin specifically, but instead speak generally about the restructuring of firms in connection with globalisation.
That was the unanimous decision.
When the word "Michelin" suddenly appears in the versions in one or two languages, then I wonder who did this.
This does not follow the agreed rules of the game.
I resolutely refuse to accept terms which have not been discussed being inserted into texts.
My group absolutely refuses to approve this!
I would ask all Groups to uphold the principles of fairness and mutual arrangements in this House.
(Loud applause from the right)
