Mr President, we have latterly been discussing technical regulations, technical details, regarding which one might ask whether such details are actually the concern of Parliament.
Transport safety in all transport operators has always been an important matter of concern to Parliament, particularly, of course, in the transportation of dangerous goods.
The annoying thing about the matter before us is that the CEN, the European Committee for Standardisation, is extremely dilatory.
We therefore find ourselves in the situation of having to concede an extension to the time limit for, as the rapporteur said, it would be senseless if all Member States were now going to have to issue further individual regulations for a set period of time.
We therefore need common regulations which are as strict as possible, also for the transportation of dangerous goods.
Consequently, one can only fully endorse the proposal of the rapporteur, our committee chairman, and also thank him for the work which he inevitably took on himself.
This would have been superfluous if the other authorities had completed their work in good time.
