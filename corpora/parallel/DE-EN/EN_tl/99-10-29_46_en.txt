Mr President, I wholeheartedly endorse this excellent report by Mr Cunha as it brings very much to the fore the principle of sustainability which is necessary for a forward-looking fisheries policy.
Angola is suffering under the consequences of the Soviet colonialism which plundered this country.
I therefore consider the role of the European Union to be positive and important and also regard this fisheries agreement as being an integral part of our foreign and development policy.
Mr President, to conclude, I would like to make one more personal observation: I am delighted that you have been chairing this sitting here today.
That puts me in a more conciliatory frame of mind.
I hope that one day you will be just as pleased to be the President of this Friday club as your predecessor, President Gut√≠errez!
