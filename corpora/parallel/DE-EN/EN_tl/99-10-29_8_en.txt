Madam President, you have quite rightly said that we should never have to vote a second time, yet this is precisely what we did yesterday.
There were certain reasons for this as the roll call vote had been forgotten.
However, yesterday afternoon, we had another attempt to take a vote for a second time.
I call upon you, Madam President, and your colleagues, to reiterate the fact that once we have taken a vote, then that should, in principle, be the end of the matter and we should not keep on engaging in further debate as to whether to take a second vote.
This principle, which you have made reference to here, should be stringently observed.
