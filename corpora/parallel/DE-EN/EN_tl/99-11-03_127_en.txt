Mr President, I believe that cooperation between Russian and the European Union is one of the most important conditions for creating peace in the twenty-first century.
This involves working towards cooperation from which both sides can benefit.
Russia will always be one of Europe' s main providers of raw materials.
That is why this is important for us, as we can only maintain our own prosperity by seeking such cooperation.
And of course we also have to consider, no matter how masochistic this might perhaps sound, that in the long run we will also have to offer fair prices for raw materials.
We cannot, of course, ignore Chechnya.
It represents a vital issue and an enormous challenge.
We should remember that it was precisely these Caucasian territories round the Caspian Sea that were the cause of conflicts a hundred years ago, because they were geographically strategic, just as they are today.
After all, these events shaped the twentieth century as we know it.
I believe that this area, research, provides a way of defusing one of the main causes of such conflicts - the battle for raw materials.
So the research aspect here is also very important as regards renewable energy sources.
My next point is that the non-nuclear component of these research projects must be given clear priority.
We have seen what is happening on the nuclear side.
We need to be aware whenever we are considering Russia that it represents one of the most important challenges for the next century in terms of strategic geography.
