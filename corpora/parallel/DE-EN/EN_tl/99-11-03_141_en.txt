Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the objective of the common position before us is to provide potential purchasers of new cars with information.
They need to know what the fuel consumption and CO2 emissions are.
Great!
Tables, advertising brochures, guidelines, tips, that is all marvellous and Parliament adopted 29 amendments, of which 14 have been included in the common position.
I would like to take the liberty of praising the Austrian Presidency a little, because I think they were the ones who made this happen.
I also totally agree with the rapporteur when he says we should not waffle on!
We should accept the wonderful job done by the Council and make sure that it comes into force as quickly as possible.
As someone has already said, there are few of us left, it is late, and we are tired, but perhaps we should nevertheless look at the facts of the case, which are that CO2 emissions from private cars are constantly rising, and will continue to do so.
So we should not act as if we have saved the planet here today!
We certainly have not.
We missed the boat long ago - or rather we missed a lot of cars.
We will not save the world with this directive.
It is necessary, it is important, and I am delighted that we have it, and perhaps we will all have a bit less of a guilty conscience the next time we get into our cars, but we should not imagine that we can really save the world with such minimal measures, even if there are a great many of them.
We need action of a quite different kind for that.
I wonder if we will ever adopt a directive along those lines!
