Madam President, our Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats has called for us to follow the system that we always use and debate BSE on a 'catching the eye' basis.
I must say, Mr Bar√≥n Crespo, that I am absolutely amazed that you are demanding an impromptu debate now.
You criticised me last week when I called for the Napoletano report to be referred back, for quite understandable reasons as we saw it.
You said that conflicted with the agreements.
Fair enough, I had to accept that.
This morning our group considered this afternoon' s discussion.
Some Members in the group also felt that there should be a debate.
The Members who called for that will recall that I said that we had no idea what the other groups' positions were.
I said it would be unfair to demand a debate here, because we could prepare ourselves for the debate, whereas the other groups would be unprepared.
Therefore, as a matter of principle, we are not in favour of having an ad hoc debate which this House is not prepared for.
That is why I am in favour of sticking to the present procedure.
Commissioner Byrne will make a statement to us, and we will then discuss it using the 'catching the eye' system and ask our questions.
We should then deal with this serious topic at a later date in a very orderly and serious fashion, giving us the opportunity to conclude the debate with a resolution.
But right now we are most definitely opposed to having a debate sprung on us under the ad hoc procedure!
(Applause from the PPE group)
