Madam President.
(Heckling by Mr Martinez)
Oh, just shut your trap!
Commissioner, I believe that as long as we do not have consistent labelling, we will never be free of disputes about BSE in this House and in Europe in general.
The fact that you are now telling us that compulsory labelling going back to animals' place of birth will not be implemented until 2003 - Mr BÃ¶ge has already touched on this - well, in my opinion that is partly to blame for this whole cankerous BSE crisis.
Now that the legal basis has changed - and that is the reason why we have this new regulation now - so that this is no longer to be dealt with under Article 37, that is by means of consultation, but under Article 152, under the co-decision procedure - we in this House damned well have a duty to bring this deadline forward from 2003!
Yes, that is our duty, and my question to you is this: you said that you would put pressure on these countries concerning this issue, which is to be the subject of a decision in the next few days.
I would like to know what scope the Commission has for exerting pressure so that these Member States bring in consistent labelling and identification of bovine animals before 2003?
If that could be done as quickly as possible, we in this House would not have to worry about BSE any more!
