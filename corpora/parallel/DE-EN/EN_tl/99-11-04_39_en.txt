Mr President, my views involve some important distinctions.
For example, I see the enhancement of regional and local employment initiatives and the greater emphasis on equal opportunities for women in employment policy as being positive, although I believe that Mrs Theorin' s criticism in this respect is still valid.
Nevertheless, I think that the basic positions are inadequate.
Each one of us has too many unemployed people amongst his or her constituents.
We should have rejected that old chestnut put forward by the Commission that the unemployed ought to be encouraged, by deregulating the labour market and imposing social constraints, to look for work or seek assistance under employment policy measures.
I believe that the causes of mass unemployment are essentially structural and socio-political.
Sweeping references to service sector jobs in the USA make the picture quite clear: everyone knows that these are mainly underpaid jobs with no social security net.
Anyone who wants to follow this US model is accepting or even participating in the destruction of the welfare state in Europe.
I also regret that it has become fashionable to ignore macroeconomic analysis.
As long as financial markets are more lucrative than investing in business, then the problem of unemployment will no doubt remain unsolved.
I therefore urge you, ladies and gentlemen, to support the amendment that refers to this.
