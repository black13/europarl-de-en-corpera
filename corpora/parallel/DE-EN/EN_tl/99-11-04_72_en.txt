Madam President, I would like to make three preliminary remarks.
Firstly, I would like to make it clear that the opinion I am presenting represents the position of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, even if my own views are somewhat different.
That sometimes happens.
Secondly, in some cases I am rejecting new amendments, where I think that they add nothing new in terms of content.
I am in favour of presenting focused proposals to the Council of Ministers.
Thirdly, there are, of course, other amendments that I am rejecting because of their content, such as Amendment No 46, which suggests reductions in working hours without cuts in payments are the only effective approach.
I am in favour of flexible working.
