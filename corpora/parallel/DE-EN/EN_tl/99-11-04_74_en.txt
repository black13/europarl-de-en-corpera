Madam President, with regard to Amendment No 13, I have nothing against the proposal to take a joint vote on this, but I wish to point out that the German version is incorrect.
This amendment was also proposed as an oral amendment in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
That oral amendment from Mr Skinner is not included here, nor is Mrs Sbabarti' s statement on the policy with regard to disabled persons.
This applies to the German version.
Although the explanatory statement is once again correct, it is wrong in the original German version.
I would like to see a vote on what we agreed in committee.
Besides, the English version seems correct to me.
