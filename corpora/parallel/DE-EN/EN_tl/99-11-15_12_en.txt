Madam President, I have a question about the agenda you are proposing.
On Wednesday, we also have the important Dimitrakopoulos-Leinen report.
How do things stand on timing?
Do we have enough time to consider this report as well, given how important it is for the future of the European Union?
Both rapporteurs deserve to have a reasonable amount of time devoted to their report.
Could you comment on this, please?
