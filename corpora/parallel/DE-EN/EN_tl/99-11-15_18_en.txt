Madam President, I just wanted to say that I am against Mr Bar√≥n Crespo' s suggestion that we should cancel Question Time.
I regard Question Time as a fundamental parliamentary right, which unlike other agenda items is specifically protected in legal terms, and I would like to insist that the full Question Time should be held.
I do of course understand that there are problems with time, but that is simply because we have relatively little time and a great deal to discuss, and the people who are now complaining about this are precisely the ones we wanted to shorten the plenary weeks a little while back.
At the time I protested against that unrealistic proposal and thank goodness that succeeded.
We used to have Council representatives here on two days: Wednesdays and Thursdays, and we had Council Question Time on Wednesday evening.
That worked brilliantly.
Somewhere along the line they cut Council attendance to one day, and that is the cause of the problems.
