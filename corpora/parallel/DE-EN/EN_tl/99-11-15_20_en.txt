Madam President, I agree that we should have the Commissioner here when we discuss Chechnya.
I also agree that we should discuss the situation in Chechnya at 3 p.m., but I would like to request that the debate on the Intergovernmental Conference should be taken in one go.
I support Mr Bar√≥n Crespo' s idea of waiting until we have completed the debate and then finishing with the "Questions to the Council" agenda item.
It would be wrong to consider a topic as important as the Intergovernmental Conference in bits and pieces, with a little bit on Wednesday and then perhaps another bit on Thursday morning.
We should be able to debate this subject without interruption.
