Mr President, we are looking at a proposal for a directive under the Auto-Oil programme, with the aim of improving air quality by the year 2010 by reducing emissions from motor vehicles.
I personally feel that the Council has included many highly important provisions in its common position, such as reducing emission limits for carbon monoxide by October 2000 or 2001 by 30% in comparison with 1996.
We always face the same problem, and I can remember our discussing that, Mr Lange: you promised to come to an arrangement with the Council so that your amendments would be accepted in part.
The question now is this: what are we to do?
Are we to vote for your amendments tomorrow or the day after?
Will there be a hold-up?
I wonder what is really better for the environment now.
I very much regret that the arrangement with the Council has not worked out.
We are really faced with a decision on a matter of conscience, and this evening I will have another very good look at all this, because things have not worked out as we discussed in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection.
There is one thing we need to be clear about: the Council has accepted a great many important points here, but our cars are not yet clean by a long chalk, and they never will be.
Who would have believed that we would now be facing an explosion in traffic not only in the industrialised nations but also in the Third World?
It has not even begun to take off in those countries yet, and it is bound to grow further - and I can only wish for the population of those countries that it will.
Perhaps, Mr Lange, you could try again to reach some sort of compromise with the Council during an overnight meeting.
In that way, we will all be relieved from having to decide on a matter of principle, that is whether to vote against your very good report - which I would dearly like to vote for - or else, I think it is fair to say, to vote against the environment, by procrastinating yet again.
