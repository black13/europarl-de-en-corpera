Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Avil√©s Perea for this report, because with it she has provided us with another instrument to combat violence against women and children, and also, above all, to identify how and where violence occurs.
The term violence is defined more precisely here, as violence can mean any type of exercise or abuse of power, injury or duress.
All forms of violence should be rejected, but all too often there is a very high level of tolerance amongst families regarding violence.
Violence against women should therefore be identified more actively, so that help can be provided.
We also know that acts of violence increase if no sanctions are taken.
It is difficult for victims to escape from violent relationships without outside help.
The women and children affected need active support, and above all protection.
It is society' s job - everybody' s job - to make available the best possible support measuresand protection instruments.
Daphne is a support measure that makes it possible for us to combat this.
However, legal measures will also be needed in individual countries.
Let me take Austria as an example.
Austria has been in the vanguard with a law providing protection against violence in force since 1997.
This is known as the expulsion law, and under it violent men can be expelled and women can no longer be forced to flee with their children to women' s refuges and other similar establishments.
The expulsion law initially applies for seven days and can if necessary be extended up to the divorce date.
I would now like to invite other countries also to adopt a law of this kind, as it would help to ensure that women and their dignity are protected.
