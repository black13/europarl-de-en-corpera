Mr President, Commissioner, I share your belief that this is a problem which must be handled extremely carefully.
You rightly stated that we must take scientific opinions seriously and I assume that British farmers wish to sell safe beef as soon as possible and not wait two years until they can do so.
For this reason, no one in this House, nor indeed anyone at all, can really want to see treaty infringement proceedings which will take two to three years and create nothing but uncertainty in the European Union during this time.
Mr Byrne, can you tell me how you will be able to ensure that objections at a scientific level are investigated in the shortest possible time so that Member States are not able to repeatedly raise objections and to apply laws without needing to prove their case?
Can you also tell me that you will make clear to Germany that you are expecting constitutional barriers, such as a resolution of the Bundesrat at the earliest possible opportunity?
Mr Byrne, finally I would like to ask one more question which I have already asked in Brussels.
Would you please be a little clearer about the issue of testing?
When will you present the House with a proposal to prescribe BSE testing as compulsory in the European Union?
