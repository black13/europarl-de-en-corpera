Mr President, I consider that this is a black day for consumer protection!
Mr Byrne, you promised when you entered office that you stood for preventive consumer protection and for transparency.
I would like to ask you, as my colleague has already asked, how you tie that in with the precautionary principle and credibility.
In the hormone dispute we are taking the side of the precautionary principle, but not here.
This seems to be a form of force-feeding if consumers do not have the option to be informed.
How can you promise transparency for the consumer and also postpone the date for labelling?
How do consumers have the right to freely decide for or against this meat?
What do you think about Article 36 being violated?
Article 36 gives Member States the option, when there are health risks, to impose an embargo.
Where is there more doubt than here?
We know little about the incubation time.
You know that the advisers have expressed grave doubts, including doubts over the problem of transferability.
So that is my question.
I believe that that you are undermining Article 36 and that you are trampling underfoot the precautionary principle and transparency for consumers by taking this decision prematurely instead of actually ensuring that foodstuffs are exactly what they should be, suitable to eat and free from health risks!
