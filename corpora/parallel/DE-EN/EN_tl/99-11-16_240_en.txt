The term "promote" is probably not appropriate in this context.
We are negotiating here with sovereign states.
The ways and means with which we interact with our partners are not such that I would like to use the term "promote" , particularly concerning something for which there is no acquis.
We can of course expect, as it is the basis for association, that the accession candidates take on everything which is legally regulated in the European Union.
However, what goes on in terms of social interaction is not legally regulated.
In this case, political dialogue, which is also a part of the accession strategy, repeatedly makes reference to the need for intensive social dialogue.
We have done this in the past and we will continue to do it in the future, in which regard I would also like to point out to you that in this matter the situation is very different, that is in no way do the majority of the accession candidates fall short of the standard of the Member States.
