But of course.
That is the whole point, but under certain preconditions.
Firstly, with regard to the visa obligation we do not want to allow any exceptions.
The Council regulation is clear on this.
If we make exceptions here, then we are giving up the basic principle of a uniform area of freedom, security and justice.
I must point out at this juncture, as you have rightly said, that the subject is highly sensitive.
The sensitivity is not just in the fact that it is difficult for the candidates to implement this.
The greatest sensitivity is in the fact that I know a number of Member States which will not accept enlargement unless there is total clarity in this matter.
We need not just the agreement of the candidate countries, but also of the Member States, and for most Member States this is a crucial point on which no compromise is possible.
With regard to controls on external borders, the applicant countries expect that on accession they will take on and apply the acquis communautaire of the EU, as I have said.
The controls on internal borders will only be abolished if the EU confirms that the applicant country can fully guarantee effective implementation of the acquis communautaire of the EU in this matter.
However, your question was whether internal controls will disappear?
The answer is a definite yes.
That is what it is all about!
