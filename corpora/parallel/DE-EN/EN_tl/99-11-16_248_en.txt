Mr Posselt, the Commission is aware of the study submitted by four Czech opposition parties on the alignment of laws in the Czech Republic.
However, I must point out that this study was first presented to the press and to the Czech public before a copy was given to the EU delegation in Prague.
I myself did not receive a copy, not even when I met the previous week in Prague with representatives of the parties which produced the study.
Unfortunately, therefore, I cannot personally speak about the contents of this study.
