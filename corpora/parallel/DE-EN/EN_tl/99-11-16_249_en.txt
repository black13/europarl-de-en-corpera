Mr President, I find that very interesting.
I was told that this study had been sent to you personally.
But irrespective of that I would like to say that I support these four opposition parties and also many social democrats who fully advocate European integration.
I also regret the resignation of Mr Lansky, who worked hard in this matter, but I do see the danger of a debate arising in the Czech Republic and I would like to mention this to you.
It has been said by another party which previously governed, a large opposition party, that there could be membership Ã  la carte; there is talk of a status being accorded which is akin to that of Turkey, of a political discount, and I would like to ask you whether you consider such thinking plausible or whether you presuppose full implementation of the acquis communautaire.
