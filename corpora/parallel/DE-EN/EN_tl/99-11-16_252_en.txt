Mr President, I would just like to say on a personal note that it was the furthest thing from my mind to suggest that the Commissioner had not received the paper and had lied, although it was stated publicly in the Czech Republic that this study had been sent to you and that you had not yet responded.
This was the reason for my question and I thank you for clearing up the matter.
I did not mean to suggest anything.
There must be reasons why you did not receive it, but I never suggested that you had lied!
