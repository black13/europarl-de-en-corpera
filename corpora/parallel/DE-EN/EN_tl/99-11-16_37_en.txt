I do not share your view Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf.
However, you all know what my view is on the issue of the division between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure.
This division is an existing state of affairs though and one that will certainly merit more and more discussion.
Regarding the matter of interchangeability between these two categories, I might point out that in the course of the debate on the next report we will discuss how those funds that were not required in the agricultural sector - i.e. in the 1A categories, in respect of market regulation measures - on account of price and market trends, can be re-allocated and made available for other measures.
