Mr Colom i Naval, the decision was taken in Agenda 2000 to create a separate heading for expenditure on enlargement.
In fact, the decision was also taken to establish measures for development aid in the agricultural policy sector now.
I believe that was an important decision.
When it comes to the question as to whether the expenditure earmarked for agricultural policy will be sufficient, it is certainly necessary to keep a constant eye on how the situation in the applicant countries is evolving and to establish what the assumptions were that the Berlin Summit based its estimate of necessary expenditure on.
If I conclude that these assumptions will need to be revised, then I will inform Parliament immediately and, I will, of course, make it my business to enter into discussion with the Committee on Budgets on how the situation should be handled.
