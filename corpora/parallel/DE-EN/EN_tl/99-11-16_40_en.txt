Ladies and gentlemen, I have granted two requests to speak over and above the speakers ' list since we are well on schedule.
We will not always be able to do this but when the opportunity allows I believe we should take it, for it would do this House no harm whatsoever if the debates were to become more spontaneous and political than is usually the case.
But as I said, no permanent rights derive from this in the sense of a precedent being set.
Whether there is opportunity for something like this depends on how disciplined you are about keeping to your speaking time.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
