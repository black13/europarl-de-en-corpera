Mr President, I have a specific question: Mrs Schreyer, you said that the list will be made available to us before the end of today.
Which list is that?
The list of eleven or a list of four?
Mr BÃ¶sch explained it in great detail.
I would like to warn of the fact that we are not pursuing the procedures properly.
They are clearly set out in Regulation 1037/1999 and in the interinstitutional agreement.
Parliament is not in a position to say "we will hear eleven ", or if there is another list, "we will hear four" !
That is not how it works!
We cannot afford to open up the possibility of those who were placed on the list by the monitoring committee taking legal action.
First of all you must reach agreement with the monitoring committee and then you must officially pass the list on to us so that we can then set our own procedure in train, come to an agreement with the Council and then make a proposal to you as regards who to appoint.
Ultimately therefore, you appoint in name only, but the procedure leading up to this must be conducted properly.
Could you please tell us exactly which list it is you intend to make available to us today?
