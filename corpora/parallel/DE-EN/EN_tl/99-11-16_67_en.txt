Mr President, environmental considerations are very important in the field of energy and that is why I would like to thank Mr Chichester warmly for his report, which addresses the right questions in substance.
Approximately 50% of our energy requirement in Europe is met by mineral oil and 25% by gas, which means that Â¾ of our energy currently derives from fossil energy sources.
If we take as read that we import more than 50% of the European Union' s total energy requirement then we definitely need to ask ourselves the following question: how can we guarantee reliability of supply in the face of climate change, which in view of the worldwide CO2 problem may, indeed will affect us, not just if there is a failure to take preventive action on our part, but, above all, if there are changes in the political climate?
Speaking of changes in the political climate, I would like to point out that we are extremely dependent on certain regions.
39% of the gas we use has to be imported and 41% of this comes from the CIS States.
Gas consumption is experiencing very rapid growth in the European Union and energy imports to the European Union are still rising at a rate of 0.9% per annum.
We have made good progress where the environment is concerned.
CO2 levels are constant to rising slightly, we achieved a 30% reduction in SO2 levels between 1990 and 1994 and a 9% reduction in the case of NOx.
Nuclear power cannot be the answer to our problems.
That is why the Austrian delegation intends to abstain when it comes to consideration L and section 5.
Increasingly, nuclear energy is being replaced by gas.
That is why we consider reliability of supply in this sector to be paramount and also why Parliament does not intend to give way in the negotiations with the Council on ALTENER and SAVE - that is to say with EUR 81 million and EUR 68 million.
We need reliability of supply, we need competitive energy!
