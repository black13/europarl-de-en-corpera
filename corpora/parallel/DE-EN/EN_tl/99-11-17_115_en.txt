Mr President, I am extremely worried that worldwide there are increasing attempts to resolve conflicts using military means.
Russia is no exception in this, which is particularly painful for the European Left; it is acting as it sees fit and no differently from NATO in Yugoslavia.
I consider the applause which you gave Mr Solana this morning and now the applause for the speech made by Mr Cohn-Bendit to be opportunism of the worst kind.
I simply must say this!
To reverse the trend, that is away from the military and towards conflict prevention and peaceful conflict settlement, is the crucial challenge facing this European Parliament.
We have logically assessed the war in Chechnya and we have also deferred our decision on further expansion of cooperation with Russia.
We expect the same of the Council.
Yesterday' s declaration by the Council is a positive sign but it is too late.
It is to be hoped that the Council does not need as long to follow up our proposal to freeze the expansion of relations and the TACIS programmes for Russia until such time as the weapons finally fall silent.
The attacks on refugees and residential areas, the closing of the borders and the hindrance of international aid organisations providing humanitarian aid not only contravene the Geneva Convention on the protection of civilians in war zones and other international obligations but are quite simply inhuman and totally unacceptable.
I consider it self-evident and indispensable that the European Union increase its humanitarian aid for the people of this region.
However, we must not release Russia from its responsibility to protect and provide for refugees and itself to care for the people in the war zone.
The same also applies for the reconstruction of the country.
