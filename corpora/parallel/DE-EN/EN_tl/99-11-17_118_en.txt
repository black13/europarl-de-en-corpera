Mr President, just as the previous speaker stated, the last few weeks have shown that the actual scale of things in the Caucasus is considerably greater and also encompasses the entire Caspian Sea.
Of course, in the current phase of the war in and around Chechnya we need to see damage limitation as the most important issue and to provide the swiftest possible emergency aid for the population.
However, whilst the real interests in the Caucasus are not openly declared and remain undisclosed the attempts at resolution will not work.
Each person interprets the causes of the war using the arguments which best suit his own theory.
There is no admission that this area is one of the largest stores of raw materials in the world and that many multinational interests are focused on this area.
So long as greed for these possessions and for the resources in this area remains unconquered - and this applies equally to Europe and many other states - the conflicts in this region will not be resolved and, long term, we also have to consider finding a major, comprehensive solution to this problem.
