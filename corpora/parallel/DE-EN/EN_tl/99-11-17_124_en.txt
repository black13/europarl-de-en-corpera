Mr President, I do not need to repeat what the Commission and the Council have said on the situation in Chechnya.
I would just like to emphasise one area which can serve as a justification for our joint resolution on Chechnya: the suffering of the civilian population; the hundreds of fatalities; the 200,000 refugees and their plight given the onset of winter; the overreaction of the Russian government and the indiscriminate bombing of the civilian population.
I have the impression that this is not a legitimate war against terrorist activity, but a political power struggle at the cost of the population.
For this reason our Parliament must clearly say what it wants and what it doesn' t want.
I shall summarise: firstly, we are not disputing the right of the Russian government to fight the brutal terrorism in Dagestan.
Secondly, we in no way wish to jeopardise the territorial integrity of the Russian Federation.
Thirdly, however, we cannot condone aeroplanes bombing the civilian population!
I condemn these bombings, just as months ago I condemned the bombings of Novi Sad, Belgrade and Nis, which were described as "collateral damage" .
