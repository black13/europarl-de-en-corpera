Mr President, Mr Schwaiger, true, your report is very comprehensive, but it is rather too non-committal, and there are a number of points it fails to address.
What, for example, has come of the demand for an analysis of the WTO' s influence so far upon, for example, developing countries, the environment, the EU and existing treaties before we get into the next round of negotiations?
To say, Commissioner Lamy, that there were no tools or methods for doing this and that these would first have had to be developed is simply laughable.
In revising the uniquely constituted Lom√© Conventions, the refrain is always that that these ought not to remain in that form and that they are not WTO specific.
What we should be demanding, however, is that the ground rules governing world trade must be focused upon the needs of people here in Europe and in developing countries.
They must be enlisted in the service of sustainability and of social needs and not of the interests of corporations and their shareholders.
This must be the main requirement and not a new round of liberalisation which serves only to incite people worldwide to compete for the lowest wages under the worst social and ecological conditions.
In our opinion, the WTO needs to be fundamentally reformed before there are any further negotiations at all.
Our goal must be nothing less than a fairer and socially and ecologically more responsible form of world trade which honours the interdependence of nations.
