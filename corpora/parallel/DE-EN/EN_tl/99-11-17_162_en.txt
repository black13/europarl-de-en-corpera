Mr President, three brief remarks about the Millennium Round and cultural diversity.
First of all, the EU is a success story, an economic community which has put its faith in open markets and given people security in the social sphere, together with economic prosperity.
However, the European Union is not only an economic community but also a community of values.
To uphold these values and to secure the cultural diversity of Europe are indispensable tasks at a time when the economies of the world are increasingly interrelated.
I should therefore particularly like to thank Mr Schwaiger, the rapporteur, who has done an excellent job in the way he has introduced the subject of securing the cultural heritage of Europe into the report for the Millennium Round.
In the meantime, there are two goals.
On the one hand, the dynamic development of electronic services ought not to be impeded.
On the contrary, it must be facilitated for, like no other branch of industry, it guarantees jobs that are safe for the future, both in Europe and worldwide.
On the other hand, we shall have to be in a position to support and promote the diversity of our European cultural heritage in the future too, and this by means of promotional measures taken also by the Member States.
The Schwaiger report facilitates both goals.
It has therefore earned broad support from us all.
