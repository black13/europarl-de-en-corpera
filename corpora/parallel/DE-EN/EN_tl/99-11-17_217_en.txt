Mr President, you will not believe this, but exactly 200 years ago, namely in 1799, there was the first discussion of a constitution, not for Europe but for Bavaria.
This was partly for the purpose of establishing responsibilities but also because of the radical shifts in territory due to an almost 83 per cent increase in the area of Bavaria.
The person with the big idea of having a constitution was the then Bavarian prime minister, Graf Montgelas, who did himself great credit by establishing a French administration in Bavaria.
However, he was at the same time also the fiercest opponent of a parliament, because this could supposedly introduce unpredictable factors into politics.
The arguments for and against went on for a further 18 years until at last the constitution was established and its opponents were finally quashed.
And there were then already democratic elements in this constitution.
Now, something else that is astonishing: the basis of the constitution was, at that time, a preamble which was drafted in 1799 and which was to set out the fundamental rights, and all this 200 years ago!
I think the parallels between then and now are quite amazing.
History shows that the doubters' arguments, both then and now, are almost the same.
Let us learn from history not to allow further decades to go by before Europe has a constitution.
This is something for the future that we must prepare for.
I should therefore like to encourage the Council not only to respect Parliament' s proposals but also to make them its own.
We need a Europe which is able to act and which can also take necessary decisions.
For we must also take democracy seriously, and the responsibilities which the national parliaments have given away must pass into the hands of the European Parliament, that is to say become part of the process of codecision making.
We need codecision making by the European Parliament, for the European Parliament is the biggest factor favouring the integration of Europe.
