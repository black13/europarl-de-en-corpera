Mr President, this debate has shown that a lot more would be necessary than we have incorporated into our report.
Budget policy, trade policy, tax policy and competition policy have been mentioned.
Everywhere, in fact, there is a need for reform; to that extent, Parliament was very focused.
I nonetheless think that we ought to be as ambitious as the Commission and carry out a further two improvements tomorrow.
The latter I am happy to take up - a duly facilitated revision of the second part of the newly divided Treaties and also a clause concerning strengthened cooperation in a Europe with 27 or 30 States.
I also hope that this will obtain a majority in the House tomorrow.
Lastly, I should like to thank the Commission whose demands are almost identical with those of Parliament.
Now, it is a question of conducting a public debate with the governments but also with the populations of Europe so that we might also implement the results at the Intergovernmental Conference in the year 2000.
I would like to thank everybody who has contributed to this task.
