Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, may I thank you for the clear opinion you have expressed.
I can really only register with indignation the fact that Mr Theonas is displaying sympathy here for a war criminal.
I should like, however, to ask you quite specifically what the Council - apart from these sanctions, which I fully and completely approve of - is planning to do in order to provide concrete support to the Serbian opposition this winter.
Is a meeting planned, and are there concrete measures to support the Serbian democratic opposition?
For that would be of use to the Serbian people!
