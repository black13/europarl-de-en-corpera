Mr President, on behalf of the Legal Committee, for which I had the pleasure of being rapporteur, I would like to warmly welcome the rapporteur' s well-balanced resolution.
In my opinion, the rapporteur has succeeded in sending out three signals in the report: to our worldwide partners, a signal of the resolve of the European Union; to our people, a signal for a human face to globalisation; and to our citizens, a signal of the parliamentary dimension of the WTO process.
In this resolution, the Parliament is giving the Commission full backing for Seattle.
Our message to our partners is that we are solidly behind our negotiating leaders in Seattle - as solidly as the European Alps, I would say.
All the participants should be aware of this.
Our second signal is to the people who sceptically oppose globalisation.
We want to give the markets a worldwide framework as well.
We can and we desire to bring about globalisation.
The market system will keep pace with its global development and so we are following a liberal and antiprotectionist tendency.
The losers in globalisation or those who support it should know that they have an advocate.
Finally, we would like to state quite clearly that this Millennium Round also has a parliamentary dimension.
This is indispensable because it is no longer just about the reduction of tariffs and quotas; it is also about elementary matters such as social concern, environmental protection and fair competition.
We should also make this clear to the non-governmental organisations.
The place for political debate on the Millennium Round in Europe is the European Parliament.
The governments are not negotiating this with non-governmental organisations.
