Madam President, we discussed Mr Schulz' s proposal this morning and voted on it.
For good reasons there was a clear majority in favour of taking the vote today.
Otherwise we would have not had Eurodac by the beginning of next year but the next debates would have been held sometime during next year and Eurodac would maybe have come a year later.
That would be irresponsible and there was therefore a clear decision by the Parliament to take the vote today.
