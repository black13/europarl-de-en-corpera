Madam President, may I explain?
I should like the expression "national of a third country" to remain in the text.
We had it just now in a paragraph.
I should nevertheless like the opportunity of voting in one paragraph on the age limit.
Because we have declared that we support the age of 14, but there are other opinions, namely to retain the age of 18.
That is to say, I therefore request a separate vote.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
