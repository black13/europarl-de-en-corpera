Mr President, the result has come about after a whole series of infringements of the law.
The provisions of the Rules of Procedure have been infringed on many occasions by the departments and by the majority of the Parliament.
Moreover, the result is a black day for the Parliament, because through it, what the majority of the Parliament has decided, the Parliament becomes an authority and the Members officials.
I shall, however, not let my own Parliament make me into an official.
If I think about it, the fact that the Members of Parliament according to this text are bound to assist in the work of OLAF and if they are moreover obliged to inform on people, then such a rule affects the independent mandate most profoundly.
I should like to state that such a decision that destroys the parliamentary system can clearly not be accepted but that we, and not myself alone, but many others too, will submit this matter to the European Court of Justice.
