- The proposals in the Dimitrakopoulos-Leinen report with regard to the reform of the Treaties in their institutional core areas provide for an extension of the qualified majority decision in the Council.
Moreover, according to the report, international law as such should be amended, as the Parliament should be granted a right of approval with regard to the conclusion of future Treaties.
This and many other problem issues fundamentally question the role of the Member States of the European Union as "Masters of the Treaties" .
We non-attached Members therefore reject this report.
