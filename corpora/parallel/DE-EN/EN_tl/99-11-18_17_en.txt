Madam President, I must comment here.
First of all, I can say that our colleague Bar√≥n Crespo, whom I would describe not as an accomplice, but in all our political differences as an esteemed colleague, has given a correct account of the situation, as I explained orally to him, that we also, the Group of the European People' s Party and the European Democrats, wish for a vote to be taken on the Napolitano report.
I gave this explanation orally to Baron Crespo, but did not sign the proposal, because just before his request that I sign it, I had a conversation with a representative of your Office.
As the Group of the European People' s Party and the European Democrats, we said that we could and wished to help to carry it, if the problems in the Napolitano report are resolved to a certain extent and they are indeed at the limit so that we can also vote, although in no way are we really happy with the situation.
We said that we wished to conclude this tiresome business in November.
And we keep to our word.
But it is of course the responsibility of the President of the Parliament to ensure that the procedures run properly.
We assume that the urgent procedure can be dealt with in accordance with the rules.
On this basis we support the vote on Thursday, that is to say, today, so that we can bring this tiresome matter to a close.
But we expect that everything is in order with regard to the formal procedure.
