Mr President, Mr Sakellariou, I can immediately endorse what you have said.
I was there in October.
I can confirm that the military power could not resolve the problems on the spot.
On the contrary, the old principle is being borne out: violence breeds violence.
The international community in fact has no solution to the Kosovo conflict that exists just as it did before.
The conflict is there as it was previously.
The international community does say that Kosovo is part of the rest of Yugoslavia and we are creating a multi-ethnic society.
But the reality in Kosovo is completely different.
Everyone who is there and everyone who works there knows that, and that includes the EU officials.
The former KLA, Mr Sakellariou, I can stress, feels that it is the victor and, through the mainly economic international aid, feels that this victory is confirmed.
All the parties theoretically declare that the Serbs, Roma and Albanians can live together but in practice the situation in Pristina is different.
You can no longer see the Cyrillic alphabet.
It has all been destroyed, because the Slav language may no longer be spoken.
For all Serbs who live in Pristina this means that they can really no longer take part in public life.
This is Pristina, a city full of international organisations!
In MÃ­trovica the situation is much worse.
The city is completely divided and is becoming more markedly so day by day.
Why is that?
The reason is simply that we only concentrate on economic aid and forget the crucial things, that is to say, the practise of tolerance, the practise of democracy and aid in the social field.
There is no money available for these things on the spot.
Mr Kouchner knows that reconstruction in Kosovo will fail on the very matter of the protection of the minorities.
He is not receiving any help from the EU in that regard.
