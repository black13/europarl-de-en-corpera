Mr President, today' s debate has until now unfortunately been really one-sided as we have forgotten to be self-critical.
We have for years ignored the oppression that went on for 10 years in Kosovo.
Doris Pack and others did not do so, but a large majority did.
We are ourselves to blame, at least those who held this attitude, for the fact that Rugova was frozen out, because he was left alone for 10 years with his non-violence.
It is quite clear that in a desperate situation, in which hundreds of thousands of people were driven out by systematic state violence - and that is the big difference with the current isolated acts of revenge that are of course despicable - Rugova lost control of the forces.
We should for a start see clearly that condemning others can be a good thing, but it would also be a good thing to exercise some self-criticism: We have above all failed in this way.
Of course we must send out a strong signal against any expulsions.
I myself come from a family who - collectively innocent - on the basis of state decrees 50 years ago, were expelled.
Any expulsion is an expulsion too many and this 20th century is likely to go down in history as the century of genocide and expulsions.
We therefore have a duty to stop every expulsion, including those in Kosovo, and we have a duty to speak up so that the ban on expulsions and the right to a homeland become the foundations of international law, so that such dreadful events are not repeated.
