Mr President, on 23 November, Alexander Nikitin will appear in court again.
He still has to face trial on an old case of "spying" .
It became clear a long time ago that he has the information in the Bellona report from sources that are accessible to the general public.
However, his expert knowledge made it possible for us to be made aware of an enormous hazard that is heading for us and is slumbering in the Arctic Ocean.
He acted with a great sense of humanity.
The EU has a special responsibility here because until now it has used the material that Alexander Nikitin compiled.
One of the essential components of the Northern dimension that was decided on in Helsinki is the issue of cleaning the Arctic Ocean and averting the danger that could affect us all.
We must therefore intervene more forcefully here so that Alexander Nikitin can finally be released and so that the accusations are dropped, because we all know that these proceedings are purely political and therefore the laws in Russia will also be infringed by these proceedings, because the old nomenclature will win again.
I believe that Alexander Nikitin has acted with enormous consideration for others and with remarkable responsibility in making this material available to us.
It is therefore necessary for the EU Mission in Moscow at least to observe this case, but also to intervene in the political dialogue, so that it is declared a political case and Alexander Nikitin can finally be released.
Alexander Nikitin should be free and honoured!
