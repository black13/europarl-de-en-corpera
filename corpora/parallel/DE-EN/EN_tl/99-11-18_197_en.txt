Mr President, the European Convention on Human Rights that also applies to Russia as a Member State of the Council of Europe, has, as it were, its headquarters here in Strasbourg.
On the other side of the river is the European Court of Human Rights, to which Mr Nikitin has appealed.
That means that what is happening in Russia is not an internal affair of a far-off land but that it is an internal affair of a European institution at whose heart are the fifteen Member States of the EU.
We therefore have an important duty to speak up for Mr Nikitin and his release so that he can finally live in humane and constitutional conditions.
We, as the EU, are also bound under the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, which not only commits Russia but ourselves too and it contains a human rights clause, to speak out most fervently on behalf of Mr Nikitin for an improvement in his conditions of detention on the spot, for his release and as I said, for fair and constitutional treatment.
It would be a disgrace if we gave way, because - as Mrs Schroedter put it so well - Mr Nikitin also acted in our interests.
We have often dealt with it here in the Parliament.
He acted on behalf of the European environment.
He acted for the rule of law on the whole continent.
We should in fact award Mr Nikitin one of our prizes here in the European Parliament.
I should therefore like to endorse this motion for a resolution most emphatically and the appeal it contains.
