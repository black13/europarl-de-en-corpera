Mr President, allow me to welcome the initiative by Germany to improve the exchange of information on counterfeit documents.
This exchange of information is of great importance for the protection and security of people in Europe.
Europe needs a legal area in which its citizens feel at home and protected.
An essential contribution to this is the cross-border regulations and protection systems that make life difficult for criminals.
The German initiative endeavours to achieve such a system.
By exchanging information on counterfeit documents the counterfeiting itself is contained.
That is an essential contribution to combating smuggling and other crimes and - I think this is very important - all other kinds of crime.
So it is quite sensibly in the proposal for a Council Decision.
The rapporteur wants to amend paragraph 3 of the preamble and limit the crimes to the offence of illegal immigration.
He implies that illegal immigration is the greatest crime that we have to combat.
My dear colleague, where do you actually live?
Have you never heard anything about drug dealers and the couriers of the money launderers with suitcases full of bank notes?
Do I really have to make you a list of travellers' crimes?
Amendment 6 is a disgrace!
It mocks our citizens who expect protection and security from the European Union.
We must vote by a large majority against this amendment.
We cannot allow ourselves the intellectual freedom to be afraid of a few poor creatures who sneak in with forged documents and at the same time guarantee serious criminals the freedom to travel.
The Legal Committee that has dealt with this matter was also unanimous and, I repeat, unanimous, in this opinion with all the other Groups after an in-depth examination and, as I said just now, I want this measure to apply to all crime.
That is the reason why my Group will vote against all these amendments in the vote tomorrow morning.
