Madam President, I am sorry to have to request your attention for a moment.
Once again, on the agenda.
With the decision that we have now taken, that is to say, to place the Napolitano report on the agenda, there is a problem for the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.
We have on the agenda the report by Mr Pirker on Eurodac, a report that is extremely controversial and which yesterday gave rise to controversial discussions in the Social Democratic Group, which led me to request the rapporteur, Mr Pirker, yesterday evening, to agree to the vote being adjourned until Brussels.
Understandably he did not agree to this.
With the decision that the plenary sitting has now taken, i.e. to place the Napolitano report on the agenda, it is foreseeable that we shall neither be able to complete the discussion of the Pirker report nor therefore will we be able to vote on it today.
That would mean that we would have to vote on such an important report a) extremely controversially and b) with a very small number of Members present.
That is not appropriate for the subject of this report.
I would therefore ask you, Madam President, to support my proposal for a vote that we remove this report from the agenda today in view of the situation and adjourn it until the December part-session in Brussels.
