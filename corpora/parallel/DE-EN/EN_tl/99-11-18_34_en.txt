Madam President, we have now heard the Commissioner as well.
That confirms to me and to all of us that we must vote today.
We need Eurodac.
We have had Tampere, and we have had a clear statement from the Council and have always had the full support of the Commissioner.
As Parliament, we cannot afford in the public' s eyes, to deliberately cause delays.
We need the system.
We should therefore amend the agenda so that the vote can take place today, as otherwise there would be excessive delays.
I would therefore ask you to take a vote on whether the vote takes place today or whether it is adjourned.
We need the vote today!
