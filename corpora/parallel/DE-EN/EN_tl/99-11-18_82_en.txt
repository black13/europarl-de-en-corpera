Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, don' t get so worked up!
This is an essential point which is really important.
From the voting point of view, Mrs Maes is quite right.
Mr Chichester, I am surprised that you of all people wanted to have the point "socially-balanced" voted on separately.
We voted for it by a large majority in the Committee.
However, the only thing that I should really like to see is that the voting procedure runs properly.
I would therefore ask you to grant Mrs Maes' request.
