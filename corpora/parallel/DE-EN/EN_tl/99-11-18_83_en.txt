Madam President, I believe we are dealing with three adjectives.
Free and fair world trade is the basis for the WTO Negotiations - that was my original text.
A proposal for an amendment was then agreed in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, where "socially-balanced" was added.
The opinions differ as to which adjectives should be added.
I feel in any case that it should be "free and fair world trade" .
Everyone agreed to that.
The question of "is socially tolerable" or "socially acceptable" was disputed.
We should therefore vote on the original text saying "free and fair world trade" and then vote separately on "socially-balanced" .
Then we would have a result on the third point.
I should in any case like to point out that "free and fair world trade" was the basis of all our work and an addition was appended here on which we should now vote.
