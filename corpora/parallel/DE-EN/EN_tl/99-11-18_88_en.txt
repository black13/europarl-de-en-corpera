Madam President, I should like to repeat once again that there was a proposal for an amendment by the PPE.
There was an oral explanation by Mr Chichester, that against the amendment he wished to keep the words "free and fair" in any case and that we should take a vote on that.
The third question is "socially-balanced" , "yes" or "no" ?
We should vote on that.
I have now understood what Mr Chichester said to me.
