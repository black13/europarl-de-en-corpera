Madam President, I am speaking now because I believe that I can propose a solution that is quite correct.
We are dealing with three terms: fair, free and socially-balanced.
Both the words "fair" and "free" are as far as I can see desired by a large majority.
The only disputed point is the term "socially-balanced" .
That was also what Mrs Maes said first of all, so it would be easiest if we voted separately on each of these three words, then we shall have the majority opinion of the Parliament on each of the three words.
The request itself is unclear.
