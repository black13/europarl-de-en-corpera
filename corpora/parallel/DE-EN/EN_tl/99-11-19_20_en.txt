- Mr President, I, along with many of my colleagues, have approved Mrs Giannakou-Koutsikou' s report.
It should be emphasised here this morning, though, that controversial discussions on this report have been held in this House for months.
In committee alone, there have been 130 amendments to this report.
Weeks of compromise discussions were needed and such a report is then voted on here on a Friday morning with a relatively modest number of people present.
As I listened to the debates here yesterday, in particular the comments of Mr Poettering, as to how dramatic and important it all now was and saying that a vote definitely had to be taken here this week, that is not now borne out by the presence of his own group here this morning.
I therefore regret that a procedure as important as this should enjoy such limited attention.
What is even more splendid is when the authors of this matter become embroiled in intensive talks afterwards.
In any case, we have given our approval so that Mrs Giannakou-Koutsikou can then see the report home with an extensive majority.
