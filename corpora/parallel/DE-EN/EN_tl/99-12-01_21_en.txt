Madam President.
You are quite right in what you have just said.
It is, of course, most encouraging to hear different views on this important issue but then, as you see, other Members ask for the floor and we really should turn our attention to the agenda and get down to work.
The Commission is here, Mrs Reding is waiting to report and we really should get down to work.
