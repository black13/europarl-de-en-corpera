Madam President, Mrs Reding, allow me to congratulate you on your initiative on the issue of doping.
We can only hope that you will make some proper headway with the people who always make out that they would fight doping.
I think we are on the right track and I wish you luck.
However, I would like to come back to what my colleague, Mr Cohn-Bendit said.
We cannot legislate because, as you said, there is no legal basis in the Treaty.
As you know, in my 1996 report, I called, on behalf of Parliament, for sport to be included in the Treaty at long last.
We wanted it to have its own line in Article 128 - under culture.
But we failed.
There is something like a declaration attached to the Treaty, but it is not enough to prevent our having to ask ourselves every year when we debate the budget, should we or should we not fund sport?
I think that if what you have said, if what you submit to the Council in Helsinki is to make sense, then we must conclude that the European Parliament is not confined to making statements on Bosman judgements or competition issues in sport, but can give sport a true value by paying more than mere lip service to it in the Treaty.
Only then will we be able to do what my colleague Mr Cohn-Bendit said, only then will we be able to use the budget to give constructive support to cross-border sporting events.
I urge you from the bottom of my heart to persuade your colleagues at the Commission to take a real step forward with the Council in Helsinki by including a sub-section on sport in the Treaty.
Only then will we be able to make any real progress on this issue!
