Madam President, Mrs Pack has spoken from the heart.
Unfortunately, she is right.
My life would be far easier if I were able to construct a sports policy on the basis of an article in the Treaty.
But, unfortunately, I have no such facility.
Only the Intergovernmental Conference could give me this facility if they were to sit down and include an article on sport in the Treaty.
Could, if etc. etc.
Will it happen?
I hope so, I pray so, I dream so.
But, as things stand, I can only say that most governments are against an article on sport in the Treaty, although there are governments which want to move in this direction.
I would like to see Parliament extend its lobbying activities on sport by helping and convincing the various governments to vote for a legal basis for sport in the Treaty similar to, and this would be most satisfactory for the purposes of subsidiarity, the legal basis for culture.
That would make our life much easier, but it is just wishful thinking and pie in the sky.
