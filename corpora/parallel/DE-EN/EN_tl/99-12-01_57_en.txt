Mr President, numerous aspects of enlargement have been raised, together with the economic, social and democratic implications.
I am certain that all these issues will be resolved in the medium or long term.
But one problem calls for immediate resolution.
I refer to the closure of high-risk nuclear reactors.
An accident would affect the whole of Europe and the longer these reactors are working the greater the likelihood of total meltdown.
It is therefore imperative that binding arrangements for the decommissioning of high risk reactors be agreed before accession negotiations begin.
Allow me to give you just one example of the nuclear policy of an applicant country: Slovakia' s technocrats and bureaucrats promised under the Communist regime to decommission Bohunice in the year 2000.
Obviously they recognised the risk.
Now, no-one knows anything about any such promise.
Just as past promises have not been honoured, there is a danger, if guaranteed decommissioning is not demanded in advance, that they will once again be forgotten.
