Mr President, I welcome the fact that the Commission has made a long overdue move towards revision of the enlargement strategy.
But that should not blind us to the fact that the enlargement strategy has still not actually been revised in certain areas, namely with regard to aid, transparency and parity.
There is still no public debate in these countries, no social dialogue, no involvement at regional or local level; what we take for granted cannot happen there because the EU instruments do not allow it.
I would also like to point out how important it is for the presidency to inject new life into this forum with a new European conference and to involve these future EU members equally in the new configuration of the European Union.
This applies both to institutional reforms and to the common objective of meeting the Kyoto objectives.
