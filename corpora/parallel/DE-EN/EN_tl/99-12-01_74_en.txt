Mr President, allow me to pick up where my colleague Mr Gawronski left off, namely the acceptance of Europe among the people of the various countries seeking to join the European Union.
It is not only Poland; other countries, such as the Czech Republic, also keep their enthusiasm for the European Union in check.
I should like to point out that the Commission' s progress report on the Czech Republic refers to a medium-sized town in the Czechia where a fence has been built down a street to separate the Czechs from the Romas.
That is hardly progress.
I have been there twice, I have spoken to the mayor, I said the fence must go and what happened?
The tabloid press of Europe is calling this fence a wall, as if it were not only the Berlin wall but the great wall of China.
It has been so blown up that the people there are, understandably, extremely angry because they assume that there is sauce for the goose and sauce for the gander in the European Union.
We have one set of rules for ourselves, and we are far from whiter than white, and we have another set of rules for applicant countries and we expect everything of them which we ourselves fail to deliver.
When we in the European Union take a look around us, at ethnic conflicts and terrorist attacks, I think that, if the boot were on the other foot, for example, if the Czech Republic were already in the Union, then it would say to a certain Member State: friend, if you do not get your house in order, then you must wait another twenty years before you become a Member State.
I simply mean we should make sure that the people are not put off.
The point is, we do not need to get on with the politicians in the applicant countries, but with the people.
That is all that counts.
