Mr President, the European Parliament will summarise this debate on Helsinki in a resolution.
As always, it will be a compromise resolution.
There is nothing wrong with that, it is the nature of the beast.
But, in this case, I fear that the willingness of the joint authors of this resolution to reach a compromise has gone too far.
I am not referring so much to what is said, although I do have, to a greater or lesser extent, some difficulty with that, such as on the subject of Turkey.
My criticism applies mainly to what is not said in the resolution.
We set too much store by the principle of hope and too little on hard facts as far as enlargement is concerned.
The Commission refers again and again in its status reports on the level of adaptation to the acquis communautaire to the fact that candidate countries, and this includes both the first wave and the second wave, are very slow in transposing and adapting to the acquis in numerous areas, such as social affairs, the environment and energy, as well as in human rights and living democracy.
That is not enough.
We should not be content to hope that a death sentence in Turkey will perhaps not be carried through.
We should not be content to hope that sometime, somewhere, what are clearly unsafe nuclear power stations will perhaps be closed.
We should not pretend that the extremely long transition periods which, in the 1980s, did not cause any real problems, may not cause any problems to the internal market.
Do we really want to accept transition periods of fifteen years or more for basic freedoms in the movement of people and in the service sector and still keep our borders open?
We are in favour of enlargement; it is the answer to the question of the future of Europe, which is precisely why we must speak a clear language, even in compromise resolutions.
