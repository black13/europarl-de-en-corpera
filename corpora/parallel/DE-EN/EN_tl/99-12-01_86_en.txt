Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission welcomes the publication of the first annual report on human rights.
I think that this publication will strengthen the visibility of the European Union in the field of human rights considerably.
The Commission was actively involved in the drafting of the report and worked closely with both the German and the Finnish Presidencies.
The Commission feels that a stronger balance should be struck between the three pillars of the European Union in future reports, in order to give a more comprehensive overview of the human rights situation at European level.
This report concentrates mainly on questions of common foreign and security policy.
One way of achieving greater balance in the future might be to take a more thematically structured approach focusing, for example, on particularly vulnerable groups, such as women and children, or specific questions, such as the monitoring of elections.
The Commission will, of course, continue to help the Presidency-in-Office to draft these reports.
Finally, I should like to point out that my colleague Chris Patten, who is very sorry that he is unable to be here today due to a foreign policy commitment, and Poul Nielson and I shall issue a communication on the promotion of human rights and democratisation in our external relations.
This communication will be adopted by the Commission in the first half of 2000 and will supplement the Council report on the human rights situation in that it will detail what specific action the Community can take in order to promote human rights in third countries, so that our declarations are backed up by serious, concrete initiatives and support.
