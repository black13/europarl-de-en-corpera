Mr President, the present report by Mrs Palacio marks the successful completion of a laborious task.
We can adopt it, put it to one side and everything will take its course.
Is it just routine then?
Not for me!
Because this report forces us to confront an issue which the European Parliament debated in the last Parliament and brought to a proper conclusion.
I am talking about uniform electoral law in Europe.
Do you remember the Anastassopoulos report in which we laid down a basis for electing Members of the European Parliament in accordance with the same principles in all the Member States?
The new Members of this House will have to look it up.
Presumably it is slowly starting to resurface in the minds of longer-serving Members.
No wonder, because this tends to be an everyday occurrence where the democratic foundations of the European Union are concerned.
Or am I wrong to say that the best proposals made by Parliament of all the nations of Europe - legitimised by virtue of being directly elected - are all too often of little value?
Often they fall victim to the idleness of the Council and the governments of the Member States.
This is the case with the Anastassopoulos report and uniform electoral law.
Parliament has adopted it.
Unfortunately, there is no sign of it being transposed.
In my opinion, this is catastrophic.
It is precisely in view of the European Union's enlargement that the public expects its democratic foundations to be consolidated.
This includes uniform electoral law with all the possibilities it has to offer, which we have described in the report.
As we vote for the Palacio report, let us express the hope that after the next European elections the relevant report will be based on uniform electoral law.
This would make the work easier and would be a substantial contribution to greater democracy and transparency in the European Union.
