Madam President, I should simply like to assure Mr Swoboda that there most certainly is a European culture.
If there were not then there would be no Europeans, and there would be no point in building a European Union.
I should like to thank the Italian MEPs concerned for setting up the wonderful Christmas crib opposite the Chamber and I would invite all colleagues to take a look at this piece of European culture.
