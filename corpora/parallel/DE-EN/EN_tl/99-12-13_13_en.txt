Madam President, with your permission I too will comment on the criticism made of the Austrian Commissioner Fischler.
Mrs Berger has, of course, already addressed this matter.
To my knowledge, Commissioner Fischler has so far visited all nine of the Austrian Provinces' liaison offices in Brussels.
You should be aware that Mr Fischler is a Tyrolean farmer: he goes where he sees fit to go and when he is there he says what he sees fit to say!
