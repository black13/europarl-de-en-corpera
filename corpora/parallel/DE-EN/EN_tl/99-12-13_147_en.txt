Mr President, increased levels of ozone and UV radiation have become risk factors throughout the world in which we live.
I agree with the rapporteur that the effects of this are now clearly visible.
Preserving the ozone layer is one of the main aims of our environment policy.
We are all responsible for preventing damage to mankind and animals as well as to the entire ecosystem.
That is why substances which destroy the ozone layer need to be replaced with alternative substances as quickly as possible.
However, realistic transitional periods need to be set for switching to alternative substances.
I wish to stress the word "realistic".
Where it is clear that alternative substances are available which do the same job, the procedure needs to be carried out within the period prescribed.
However, there are exceptions too and we also need to have a clear picture when we address these.
In the chemical industry certain refrigeration equipment is indispensable for processes of chemical manufacturing.
These refrigeration units are self-contained cooling systems and use a coolant for which no alternative is available at the present time.
The size and complexity of self-contained cooling systems also make it necessary to grant an exemption.
That is why I have tabled Amendment No 30 to the report, and I would ask for this to be taken into consideration.
These cooling systems - I should like to point out once more - are self-contained systems and the coolant does not penetrate into the atmosphere.
