Madam President, as a Member from the Freiheitliche Partei Ã–sterreichs (Austrian Freedom Party), I was elected just as democratically as any other Member of this House.
Dr Haider was elected with 42% of the vote in Carinthia in a free, democratic election.
If Members of this House, who are trying to build a united Europe, believe that in this Europe, some voters are respectable and some are not and that, therefore, some Members are respectable and some are not, then they should study the history of Europe this century.
We cannot exclude people from here, because by so doing we exclude those who elected them in democratic elections.
All of us have the right to sit here because we were democratically elected.
