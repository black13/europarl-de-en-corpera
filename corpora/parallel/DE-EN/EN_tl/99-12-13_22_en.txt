Madam President, I myself have two children who are Protestants and I always celebrate Christmas in the proper way.
I wanted to say this to my fellow Members.
However, personally I am not a Christian.
Jews, Muslims and many people of other faiths live in Europe.
For this reason I should like my colleagues to accept, at long last, that Europe is not populated solely by Christians.
Although I am not a Christian, I am still a Member of this House.
Some interventions make me wonder where on earth I am.
Does this mean that I am not a European?
Perhaps Mr Posselt might like to answer that question.
