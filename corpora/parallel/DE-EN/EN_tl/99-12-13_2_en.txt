Madam President, I should like briefly to raise one matter which concerns me.
You know that I hold you in high esteem and I also fully supported very many of the points which you made in your speech in Helsinki.
There is one point which could create a misunderstanding.
Twice in your speech you spoke of cultural integration in connection with Turkey's possible membership or candidate status.
Given that this issue is highly sensitive and that a parliamentary delegation has just returned from a short trip to Turkey, I wanted to ask you, Madam President, to clarify this matter, in particular with a view to the fact that official statements have already been made that the European Union is a Christian community.
Did your reference to cultural integration encompass this aspect?
Perhaps you could shed some light on this because I have no desire to move closer to the Islamic religion or culture, nor is it likely that we can demand movement in the opposite direction.
In any event, it would appear that for some of us, at least, this concept of cultural integration in connection with Turkey requires further explanation.
I would be very grateful if you could clarify this.
