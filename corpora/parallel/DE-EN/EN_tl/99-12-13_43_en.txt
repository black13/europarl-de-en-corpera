Madam President, I do not think that we should miss this opportunity to commemorate this anniversary, which marks a very important milestone for mankind.
We have achieved a great deal.
We could dispense with a debate because we have already achieved everything we set out to do.
However, since much remains to be done both within and outside Europe, we should at least draft a clear opinion on the subject in this Parliament.
