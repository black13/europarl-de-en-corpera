Mr President, Commissioner, in fact Seattle did not fail solely because the agenda was perhaps too ambitious or too overloaded.
Seattle also failed because it became clear that, in its present form, the WTO is neither transparent, nor subject to democratic control, nor public.
Perhaps, for once, we should also reflect on the objectives which the WTO pursues.
Many groups are in fact saying that the WTO is holding us back in our further development of social and environmental standards.
We have actually consistently called - and now there is time to do this - for a long overdue analysis to be carried out of the impact which the Marrakech Round has had on individual countries and on the various laws in those countries, and how mankind, and not just trade, can develop further.
If we look at the agriculture protocol which might have emerged we can be glad that nothing did emerge.
It is precisely this programme which would have pitted the small and medium-sized businesses in the developing countries and in the European Union against each other to compete on the lowest wages, the lowest standards and the lowest social conditions.
That is precisely what people are concerned about.
They no longer have any desire to delegate power on a permanent basis, power which is then delegated on to supranational organisations over which it is impossible to exercise further democratic control.
We saw very clearly at the European elections this year that people will not continue to vote if it is no longer in their power to have a say in what should happen in the future.
This makes it all the more important for Parliament to be given full codetermination and power of codecision in the field of foreign economic affairs, because the national parliaments have relinquished their power and supervisory role.
We in the European Parliament have not been accorded it.
We owe it to civil society outside to demand precisely this.
