Mr President, in Seattle it was not possible to dispel the underlying disquiet with the world trade situation.
Many non-governmental organisations spoke of a victory being won in Seattle.
Many of the ACP countries spoke of a victory being won for their cause in Seattle.
If we are talking in terms of victories then I have only one thing to say: nothing was won in Seattle except time, and as yet it is completely unclear to us how little time we have to devote to this matter.
The issue which we need to address is the underlying disquiet.
The fact that worldwide the environmental and social situation has not taken a turn for the better concerns us.
At the weekend, I attended a symposium with non-governmental organisations, with farmers' representatives from Honduras and employees' representatives from South America.
All of them - all - were extremely unhappy with the situation.
This did serve to show me, however, that what we actually wanted out of this world trade round was not at all clear and transparent either.
Hand on our heart then, if we glance through the newspapers, we realise that even within the European Union our concerns - whether related to environmental policy, social policy or the core labour standards - were portrayed as protectionist; even at home in the European Union we were not able to communicate our concerns, let alone within the group of States of the World Trade Organisation.
One lesson which we should draw from this would be to find answers to the following questions: how do we integrate parliamentarianism with the concerns of the non-governmental organisations?
How do we handle the new sensitive situation in which people are starting to fight back?
How do we make this work?
What platform can we offer for it?
I believe that we have laid the best foundation for successful future cooperation within the European Union, within the European Parliament.
