Mr President, Commissioner - or should I refer to you, Commissioner Lamy, as the number one negotiator at the WTO talks? - the United States has shown that it was not capable of assuming the leading role at the WTO negotiations.
Europe is the biggest exporter in the world - around 22% of exports traded on the world market come from Europe.
For us this means that we have a clear responsibility to take the lead on world trade.
It is said that without trade there is no prosperity.
To combat world poverty is a genuine and honourable undertaking.
At the end of the day, trade is a source of wealth.
One of our major aims in WTO negotiations is, ultimately, also to guarantee good health into old age.
Health is not unrelated to the life sciences and biotechnology.
I believe that we should not shy away from a debate in this sector; we should not be too cowardly also to discuss the advantages of biotechnology and the life sciences in the WTO context.
We should state clearly what is of use to us and what is damaging.
We should fight against those things which are damaging, but we should also give unambiguous support to those things which are of use to us.
Some organisational aspects also need to be contended.
We need framework rules which do not accord preferential treatment to one side.
The reform also needs to incorporate a change at ministerial level.
In the light of the principle of unanimity, we need perhaps a round of the M7 - the seven most important importing and exporting countries - so that they can sit down together and reach a preliminary decision.
We need a round of parliamentarians, perhaps with a majority voting system, and thirdly we need the non-governmental organisations, who ought to play a leading advisory role in particular in the social dialogue with the Economic and Social Committee.
Mr Lamy, I am glad that you are taking on the position of leader.
Make it clear that Europe is the number one player in world trade!
