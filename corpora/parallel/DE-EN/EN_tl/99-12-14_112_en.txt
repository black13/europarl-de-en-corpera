Mr President, Commissioner, in the final analysis, concessions are being used more and more as a way of financing urgently needed projects.
When do you expect to complete a directive on road pricing in Europe which could be used to carry out urgently needed motorway renovations and extensions?
I think that, in the final analysis, road pricing might also reduce mobility costs, if the objectives are achieved, namely fewer traffic jams, fewer accidents, and above all, more environmental protection, not only in relation to air pollution and noise but in many other areas too.
Do you think that this sort of directive will be tabled in the foreseeable future?
