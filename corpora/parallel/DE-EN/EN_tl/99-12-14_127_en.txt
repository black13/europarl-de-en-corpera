Mr President, Commissioner Patten, I think that the infrastructure in this area in particular represents a very important opportunity for the future.
We are discussing reconstruction in this area.
We are talking about EUR 500 million or a billion, an enormous amount of money, which needs to be invested.
What will you focus on?
On restoring the railways, the roads, air traffic, energy, telecommunications?
Does the Commission have a plan, if agreement is reached, on where investments should focus here?
