Thank you very much, Commissioner, for your positive and specific answer.
Macedonia was the victim first of the Communists and their successors, then it was the victim of two different boycotts and then it was the victim of the war in Kosovo.
It now has a highly multicultural government which is making a conscious effort to forge links with the Albanian sector of the population.
But it needs economic success, otherwise nationalism will break out there again.
Hence my question: first, do you believe that you personally could visit Macedonia in the foreseeable future and, secondly, do you believe, although you have already almost said as much, that an association agreement could be signed by next year?
