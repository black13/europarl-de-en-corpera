I too should like to start with a thank you to my colleagues in the Committee on Budgets.
As Greens, Mrs Buitenweg and I are both new to the Committee on Budgets and we had some difficulty settling in.
But I must say that, in contrast to national politics, what is striking in Europe is that practical politics are not party political and the European Parliament is aware of its responsibility on material matters, a responsibility which was, of course, heightened or highlighted by the poor turnout at the European elections.
We all know that we must present the citizens of Europe with a solid policy on the budget and on budgetary control and that we must ensure that both are efficient and transparent.
I consider that the European Parliament has been successful on this point in these budgetary negotiations.
I think that we leave these budgetary negotiations a stronger Parliament, in my view a very important point.
The Council must finally get it into its head that there is one thing you cannot do and that is to take on more and more at European level without entering into serious negotiations with Parliament as to how these additional commitments are to be financed.
The matters at issue this year were not only Kosovo, East Timor and the earthquakes in Turkey.
We all know that enlargement to the east was also an issue.
We all know that the conclusions of Helsinki in relation to Turkey, and in relation to enlargement to the east in general, mean that we will be taking on even more sooner or later.
That is why we need to fall back on serious negotiation as far as the budget is concerned and the Council can rejoice in the fact that this European Parliament has grown in stature and political awareness with its responsibility on budgetary matters.
We shall ensure much more emphatically in the future that there is proper implementation of the budget at European level.
