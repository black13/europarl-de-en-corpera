Mr President.
What struck me first as I studied the final document last weekend was its order of priority.
I understand perfectly well that the enlargement of the Union must be given priority in the wake of the upbeat tempo adopted by the Commission for the new accession strategy.
However, I would have considered it wiser for an enlargement Summit to give precedence to the matters facing the intergovernmental conference, thereby emphasising that even the tiniest enlargement will not work unless outstanding institutional questions are solved.
However, I was pleased to see that Helsinki resisted both the temptation and the intensive lobbying of the Commission and Parliament and basically concentrated the agenda of the intergovernmental conference on the famous Amsterdam leftovers.
This should ensure that other topics will not be dealt with until these have been wrapped up.
Improvements on Amsterdam in the institutional area not only concern fundamental matters, they also call for tremendous effort.
Whether or not the decision on Turkey was for the greater good of the Union and Turkey, only time will tell.
We very much doubt it.
By contrast, the progress made with the CFSP was extremely positive, even if it failed to answer a number of fundamental questions, including some of significance to Austria.
The current situation shows how vital progress is in this area.
The Union may well be seething inwardly, but in truth it stands paralysed and helpless in the face of events in Chechnya.
As far as employment policy is concerned, I expect more from the promised economic recovery, from the upswing, than from the action plans on paper.
But, all in all, Helsinki achieved an interesting result!
