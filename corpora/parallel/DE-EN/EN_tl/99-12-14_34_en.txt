Mr President, the Finnish Presidency has, without doubt, taken the development of the European Community forward.
However, European security policy must be seen as one of the failures of the European Community in the light of its reaction to the centres of conflict in Chechnya and Grozny.
We as a European Union will only gain credibility with the outside world and with our own people once we stop making too much of a distinction between various centres of conflict.
One of the problems as I see it, however, is in relation to the human rights of the various minorities within the Union, especially with regard to freedom of worship.
There are still huge differences within the European Member States as far as the recognition of religious minorities is concerned.
For example, it is at present practically impossible for Orthodox Jewish communities in Germany to set themselves up as an independent community.
The incoming presidency will have a special responsibility to regulate the rights of religious communities within the EU.
