Mr President, I am glad that at least Mr Patten is here to follow this important debate, because there are urgent matters which require discussion.
The Council has at last joined the flock and declared sanctions on Russia.
But given the length of time the war has already been waging in the Caucasus, this decision is, of course, far too late to bring any real solution to the conflict.
Given the massive expulsion of the civil population, it is far too weak a measure.
We have to imagine what is happening over there.
Ingushetia currently has more refugees than the indigenous population, with no humanitarian aid to compare with Kosovo.
Kosovo had humanitarian aid, here there is nothing.
That is the situation.
Which is why the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement must be suspended immediately.
Russia must be excluded from the G8 Summit and its government must not receive any more credit until a peaceful solution to the conflict has been found.
Exactly what sort of a foreign policy do we have at the moment?
It is true that military forces are being planned, but a decision on an early end to the crisis has been delayed for weeks.
Europe must not just be the Europe of oil multinationals; it must also become the Europe of human rights, which is why we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance are calling for a conference on the Caucasus in collaboration with the OSCE so that a contribution to peace in this region can finally be made.
We shall continue discussions with human rights representatives from Chechnya, including discussions of projects.
I hope that the Commission will give proper support in this matter by making a contribution to peace and prevention in the region, because that is far more important than the military forces decided on in Helsinki.
