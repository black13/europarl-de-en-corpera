Mr President, hardworking Finnish diplomacy has also endeavoured over the last six months to make progress on the employment and social side of the Community.
The creation of an Employment Committee increases the potential for Member States to improve coordination between their policies in this area.
On behalf of the PPE-DE Group, I welcome the fact that the presidency has prepared proper employment guidelines for 2000 at various councils of ministers and ministerial conferences.
Nonetheless, several national governments and the Council have not come fully on board.
As a result, only a small proportion of Parliament' s proposals on the guidelines was adopted in Helsinki.
Parliament wanted to achieve more in the fight against unemployment among the young and long-term unemployment than the Council was proposing; above all, we wanted to achieve permanent integration into the job market by reinforcing the ratio of active to passive measures, in other words, by increasing the proportion of the unemployed in training, further training or retraining, because a lack of jobs is only one side of the coin.
The other reason for unemployment in the European Union is the lack of professional qualifications.
I should like to thank the Finnish Presidency for helping to improve the coordination of European employment policy.
But the Community still has no long-term employment strategy to develop Community potential in terms of creativity, innovation, entrepreneurship, the willingness to invest and the work ethic.
Reforms to bolster dynamic competitiveness and flexibility need to be reconciled with the need both to maintain and to modernise the social security system.
We see the European model as a social order for the social market economy.
