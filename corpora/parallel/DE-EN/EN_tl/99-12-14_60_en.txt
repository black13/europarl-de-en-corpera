Mr President, today is a great day for Strasbourg.
I would disagree with Mrs Maij-Weggen.
I believe that Strasbourg is the independent and parliamentary face of a cultural Europe which has freed itself from bureaucracy and, in this respect, I am very happy about events here today.
We could put an end to the travelling circus without changing the Treaty, by doing away with the superfluous mini plenary sittings in Brussels.
We can do so quite independently.
We would start saving money almost immediately.
I invite Mrs Maij-Weggen to support me in this.
As far as the Council is concerned, I take the view that Helsinki was a Summit of peaks and troughs.
One peak was, without a doubt, the clear signal to the second group of central and eastern European countries that they were no longer isolated and that negotiations would be started with them.
I welcome this in particular in the case of Slovakia and the Baltic States.
However, the decision on Chechnya was also extremely important.
Parliament demanded quite clearly two and a half months ago that the Council suspend parts of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement and transfer financial aid and the TACIS programme to humanitarian assistance in order to bring home to Russia that it can no longer continue this genocide.
We were opposed at the time in no uncertain terms.
I am very glad that the Council is now living up to the standard which we in Parliament tried to set two and a half months ago.
I would ask the Council and the Commission to ensure that TACIS aid is transferred at once, because we can no longer back a mixture of bloodthirsty election campaigning and bloodthirsty colonial war.
We want Russia as a partner, but only as a partner which respects human rights.
This Parliament stands for a Europe of human rights, as Mr Oostlander said.
Russia can only be a partner if it ceases this genocide immediately.
