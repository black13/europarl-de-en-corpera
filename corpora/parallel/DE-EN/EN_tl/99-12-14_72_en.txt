Mr President, if we have understood the President-in-Office of the Council correctly, then this message, that the Council is moving towards Parliament' s position, is an important one.
After the events of the last few weeks, I am pleased to hear the message but I lack faith.
Which is why we need an exact overview of what this message in fact means.
Parliament has taken great pains to move towards the Council' s position over recent weeks.
Until the end, any such effort on the part of the Council was minimal.
And if there is any now, we must ask, why not a moment earlier because, if the situation really is as we have understood it - and I still have my doubts - then we now have problems with how, technically, we are supposed to ensure that everything goes according to plan.
Until that has been clarified, as far as I am concerned, the decision of the Committee on Budgets taken yesterday evening still stands.
