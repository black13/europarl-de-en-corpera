Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking now as the rapporteur of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
I must say that the budget which has now been tabled is indeed a social budget because this time, with our corrections, it takes clear account of employment policy measures.
This means that anyone who wants action in favour of families, anyone who wants young trainees to be able to gain experience abroad and anyone who really wants to combat social exclusion will vote in favour of our proposed amendments the day after tomorrow.
Anyone who wants the European employment strategy to be paid more than lip service and to be more than an item on Summit agendas but who wants the European employment strategy to be anchored at local level will vote, I am sure, in favour of our new employment policy initiatives.
A social Europe also has strong trade union and employer associations in permanent dialogue with each other.
It is never too early to start exporting this model of success to Central and Eastern Europe.
Which is why we have reversed the Council' s cutbacks here.
