Mr President.
I do not wish to encroach on members' time, but you reported at the beginning that you are now instituting Treaty infringement proceedings against France.
But the argument does not relate solely to France, it relates to Germany as well.
In the compromise forged between France and the Commission and Great Britain, it was agreed that the tests should also be used for diagnostic purposes and that English beef from this export programme should be labelled.
These requirements were also imposed by Germany.
My question is this: if you institute Treaty infringement proceedings without waiting for the results of the tests, when the tests have not even been carried out - we are still waiting for a proposal from Commissioner Byrne - and if the logistics for labelling have still not been set up, how then can you expect France and Germany to lift their import restrictions with this state of affairs?
Should the Commission not put the conditions in place and monitor them first, so that this can be done?
Mr President, we await further explanation from the Commission on the matter tomorrow.
Perhaps then we can go into it in greater depth.
