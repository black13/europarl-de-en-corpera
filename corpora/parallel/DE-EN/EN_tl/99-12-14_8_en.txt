Madam President, we have discussed this in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy.
We see no case for urgency and we would prefer to draft a report in which we can work out the accession strategy and state the position of the European Parliament.
We therefore oppose the urgency tabled by the Council.
(Parliament rejected the request for urgent procedure)
