Madam President, I should like to make a point of order and table a motion.
We in the European Parliament have asked time and again for the debates held here to be held in the presence of the competent Commissioner.
We understand that Commissioner Byrne has been held up by transport problems and that Commissioner Monti has read the Commission' s opinion.
However, I consider it absolutely necessary that the competent Commissioner should hear what Members have to say before being given the opportunity to reply, since otherwise the debate which we wish to hold does not in fact take place.
I should therefore like to move that we adjourn this debate and begin the debate on competition, as suggested, so that the Members concerned with the beef question can speak in the presence of the competent Commissioner.
I therefore move that this debate be adjourned now and that we proceed to the next item on the agenda.
