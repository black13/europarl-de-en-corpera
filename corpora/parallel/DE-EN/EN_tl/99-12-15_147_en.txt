Madam President, I should like to add to that.
I thank Mr von Wogau for his motion on a point of order.
We have learned that the Council passed a decision yesterday evening.
I deliberately repeat: passed a decision to postpone labelling for one year, before Parliament has formed an opinion or made a decision on the matter.
I move that the Council representative also be present at the debate.
