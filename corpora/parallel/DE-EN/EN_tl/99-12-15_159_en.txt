Madam President, I fear that we may waste a great deal of time on this debate on a point of order.
I moved, quite clearly, to adjourn this debate and to resume it after the debate on competition.
We have heard at least one speaker in favour and one speaker against.
We know the arguments.
I should now like to move to put it to the vote.
