Madam President, I raised a point of order some time ago.
According to the original agenda, the competition reports should now follow.
The order of this agenda was specifically amended by the Conference of Presidents in order to give Commissioner Byrne the opportunity to attend.
That was why the original agenda was amended on Monday.
As he is not yet here, I urge the House to deal with the competition reports.
Commissioner Monti has been here for some time.
He can deal with Mr Byrne' s reports in this regard.
I therefore support the motion.
