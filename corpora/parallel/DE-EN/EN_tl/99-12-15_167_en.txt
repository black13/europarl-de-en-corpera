Madam President, I refer to Article 142, paragraph 1 of our Rules of Procedure, under which an infringement of the Rules of Procedure can be pointed out to the President.
In this case it is Article 147 of the Rules of Procedure, which states that a motion to suspend must be put to the vote.
You have not allowed us to vote.
You declared the vote of 32 Members to be a vote.
That was a clear infringement of the Rules of Procedure.
We cannot allow our Bureau to push us around whenever we have a tight agenda.
