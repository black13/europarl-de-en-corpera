Madam President, Commissioner, the partial lifting of the embargo is valid law.
However, it is also valid law for a Member State to take precautions to protect its people if there is a risk to public health.
What interests me in this respect, in the short time available to me, is this: if you state in this compromise, in these two recitals, that testing will be carried out and that there will be a facility or duty to label, then we must be sure that this testing and this labelling will indeed be carried out if the import ban is lifted.
There are no logistics in place for either and no results from the possible application of this testing, including in Great Britain, have been submitted.
I therefore consider it premature to step up the debate.
You for your part, at the Commission, should implement and test the measures agreed and then reintroduce them into the negotiations.
