Mr President, I should also like to make a point of order and move that the Bureau consider calling the important debate on the four related reports on competition policy - which was originally scheduled for Wednesday morning, was then postponed to the afternoon and is now to be postponed to late evening - for the Tuesday of the January session if need be.
I would ask the Bureau to examine this motion so that we can duly complete the other items by midnight.
This is a motion which the President can examine.
