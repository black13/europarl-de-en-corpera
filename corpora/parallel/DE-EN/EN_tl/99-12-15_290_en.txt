Mr President, I would just like to give a brief justification for this motion.
As you know, we have had several timetabling problems and postponements today and not only today but also in the run up to the debate of these four reports.
Everyone who attended the preliminary discussions of the von Wogau, Rapkay, Jonckheer and Langen reports in committee is aware of the importance of competition policy and of future internal market policy to the future development of the economy and to growth and employment in Europe.
Our view is that, given the importance which the work of the European Union and which our relations with Member States, undertakings and workers will have in the future, all four reports should be debated in detail in plenary and substantiated vis-Ã -vis the public at a more convenient time.
These four reports do not, primarily, represent the culmination of processes; they are important contributions to the future debate on development.
I therefore move, on the grounds of timetabling problems and the importance of these four reports to competition policy, that we deal with them during the first part-session next year, i.e. in January, preferably on Tuesday in Strasbourg and I ask you on behalf of all the rapporteurs to support this motion.
