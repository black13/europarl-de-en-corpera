Mr President, I endorse the statements made by the rapporteur and Mr Kindermann and there is no need for me to repeat them.
I would like to express my satisfaction at having reached the point where, after years of discussion, we can consider the matter closed.
I should like to stress once again that we must be very careful when it comes to using genetically engineered drugs for preventative purposes.
Unlike in the health sector, no side effects can be tolerated in agricultural applications.
I should like to make another point as chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
We have agreed on Amendment No 3.
There was also an oral proposal for an amendment which was agreed with the Commission.
I will not go into the details, but it was not included in the report.
I should like my request for this to be clarified, entered in the Minutes and for us to have the version that we have in fact agreed upon at tomorrow' s vote.
As I have said, it was agreed with the Commission.
