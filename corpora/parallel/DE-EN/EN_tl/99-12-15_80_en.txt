Mr President.
I should like to table an oral amendment with regard to recital C on my behalf and on behalf of the Members with whom we negotiated this joint motion.
The German version says "in acknowledgement of" .
We move that this be amended to "in the knowledge of" .
That is the only oral amendment which I wish to table.
