Mr President, I too should like to make a complaint.
I have been trying to make a point of order for the last ten minutes.
It is not right of you to lump all of us sitting up here in the last two rows together and to refuse to acknowledge points of order.
I wanted to point out that the German translation was, unfortunately, lost in the commotion.
It makes no sense to turn the public address system in the House up so loud that we can no longer hear anything over our headphones.
That is my first point.
On my second point, I should like to ask that the seating arrangements be changed in future.
If you look at the seating plan, you will see that the four members of the PPE group up here in the last two rows are sitting between other groups.
It is not a very happy arrangement and it should be changed, especially in view of what has happened here today.
