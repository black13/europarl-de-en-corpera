Mr President, I have asked to speak because you have already turned your attention to the agenda.
I thought that you would make an announcement about the members of the convention working on the Charter of Citizens' Rights.
I had asked for the names of the Members of Parliament appointed by the Conference of Presidents to be officially announced to Parliament.
I was assured that the President in the chair this morning would make this announcement and that the names of the Members of the European Parliament who are members and deputy members of the convention would be included in today' s minutes.
I am therefore somewhat taken aback to learn that you have not received this list of names so that you could announce them to the House.
An official public announcement of the Members of the European Parliament appointed to the convention must be made because the convention will officially start work on Friday.
Please ensure that an official announcement is made.
