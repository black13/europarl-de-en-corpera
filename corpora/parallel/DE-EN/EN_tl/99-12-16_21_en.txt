Madam President, a brief comment on what Mr Poettering has said.
In principle, we take exactly the same view.
I should just like to point out that, if we adhere strictly to this principle, we shall have huge problems at the January plenary because a great deal has yet to be decided in the committees.
I would ask Mr Poettering to use his influence in his group to ensure that the committees are able to vote on time.
However, it is a perfectly tenable principle for the future.
