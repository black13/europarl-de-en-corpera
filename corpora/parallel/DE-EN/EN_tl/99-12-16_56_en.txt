Mr President, the signature of the budget was a scene of satisfaction, adulation, peace and joy.
However, because of a small cutback in funds, about which I wish to protest, I am not totally happy with this budget.
I voted against the budget repeatedly during the last parliamentary term because, despite unanimously approved reports on the worrying situation of beekeepers in Europe, the Commission was simply not prepared to provide the appropriations for the measures which we demanded in order to preserve beekeeping.
Since 1998 we have had a mini-heading of EUR 15 million in the budget to finance 50% of the national programme to improve the production and marketing of honey, based on a regulation which we have criticised as inadequate.
Now we have seen this mini-heading of EUR 15 million for 15 countries reduced by a third to 10 million.
I fail to understand how this could happen, given that the Commission itself quoted a funding requirement of 15 million per annum in its justification of the regulation.
I am grateful to the rapporteur for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr GÃ¶rlach, who also protested about this reduction in his letter to the chairman of the Committee on Budgets.
I should like here to register my protest that the Committee on Budgets has failed to take account of this.
I hope that a way can be found in the Council of Ministers of increasing this budget line to EUR 15 million, as in 1998 and 1999.
I shall, of course, continue to lobby steadfastly until the Commission finally proposes the various measures demanded unanimously by this Parliament to preserve beekeeping in Europe - pollination premiums, inclusion of beekeeping in the structural programmes ...

... cost EUR 65 million.
That is peanuts in a budget of 90 billion, a mere 0.072%.
