Mr President, it is with great regret that the CDU/CSU group acknowledges the decision to grant Turkey candidate status.
We consider this Council decision to be a fatal error because it will permanently encumber rather than foster relations with this important and reliable ally.
Even the Council knows that the criteria for integration have not been met and will not be met in the foreseeable future because Turkey is not even prepared to amend fundamental clauses in its constitution, such as the influence of the military.
The expectations raised in Helsinki are therefore bound to end in disappointment.
This is why we want relations with this important partner to be based on a partnership within as close an economic framework as possible, i.e. by meeting the obligations of customs union, rather than on illusionary prospects of membership.
Relations with Turkey are too important to be founded on the hypocritical act of Helsinki!
