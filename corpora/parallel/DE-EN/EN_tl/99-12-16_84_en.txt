Mr President, Commissioner, you were somewhat indignant that Parliament is addressing this question, but is it really just an administrative act?
Is it really only a question of applying current law?
I think not.
You had the opportunity to grant an exemption.
You failed to do so.
That was a political decision.
In France, for example, the legislator has decided in the light of bitter experience to set book prices by law.
That is a political decision.
When we talk of cultural diversity and the promotion of literary and scientific production, then we are talking politics.
When we sense that some people - I do not mean you, but others in the Commission - have replaced Our Father with Our shareholder value, then we are talking politics.
We have since gone into the question in greater detail.
I have said that there is a case for the decision not to grant an exemption.
But then we need national fixed book prices which work.
I am most grateful that you accept that export and re-import rules are needed.
In the final analysis, that is a general legal principle that a legal situation cannot be circumvented.
What we need, however, are import rules.
That is the decisive point which we still need to discuss.
How should import rules be worded so that national fixed book prices are not circumvented?
If we can reach agreement on this point, then I think we will have solved the problem.
My proposal is that we seek a solution on the basis of French legislation.
There is no point in having a patchwork quilt of different legal regulations in the European Union.
My request to the Commission is this: we have a legal regulation in France which works.
Please allow the others, including Germany and Austria, to find a regulation on a legal or contractual basis which works in a similar manner.
