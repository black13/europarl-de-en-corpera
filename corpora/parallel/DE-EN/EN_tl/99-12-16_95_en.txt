Mr President, Commissioner, we have discussed this issue on many occasions in the past and views have been exchanged.
Account has even been taken of recent developments.
I should therefore like to stress just a few points once again.
First, politics means shaping; politics means shaping the habitat and coexistence of people.
Secondly, the book trade is more to us than simply a sales network for books.
It creates identities and books create identities.
Thirdly, the question at issue for me is not merely cross-border trade between Austria and Germany, although that is the starting point; it is the question of the role of language areas and the role of cultural areas.
For us the relevant market is the market to which the book relates and it cannot be reduced to national borders.
For us it is, in this respect, the language and cultural area, hence the importance of cross-border fixed book prices.
It is obvious to us Austrians that a national regulation alone is not enough and that we also need an import clause and an export clause and to use the French model as a basis, because the language area and the cultural area transcend our national borders.
Commissioner, you said that you had never seen the need for conflict between culture and the market.
I share this view, provided that we state clearly what we mean by market and what we mean by the purpose of competition policy.
You said at your hearing that you were striving for competition policy and the market to further develop into a social market economy.
A social and ecological market economy includes protection for cultural assets and signals market definition.
This is precisely our debate, which is why I appeal to you to define clearly the relevant market in this context as a language and cultural area, to clarify import clauses together with the possibility for national regulation and to apply the French law to your judgement and considerations.
